"""Host half of the XenevaOS <-> host clipboard (guest side is clipd).

Text crosses QEMU's virtserialport chardev, which build_and_run_qemu.sh
exposes as a TCP socket on 127.0.0.1:43211. A stream socket has no message
boundaries of its own, so both ends frame it the same way:

    4 bytes  payload length, little endian
    1 byte   type -- 0 = clipboard contents, 1 = hello
    n bytes  payload

The guest sends the hello first and keeps resending it until a write is
accepted; that is what tells us a guest is listening, and it is also what
keeps a push from arriving before clipd has the port open (QEMU drops what
comes in before then).

Which direction this end acts on is --dir:

  host2vm   push, ignore what comes back          (copy host -> guest)
  vm2host   push nothing, apply what arrives      (copy guest -> host)
  bi        do both

The guest side is always both directions, so one image serves every mode
and the choice lives entirely here. An incoming frame equal to the last
thing we pushed is the guest echoing us back -- that is the ack, and
skipping it is what stops the two ends from relaying to each other forever.

Usage:
  Tests/clip_bridge.py --dir=bi --text 'hello from the host'
  Tests/clip_bridge.py --dir=bi                      # host clipboard
  Tests/clip_bridge.py --dir=vm2host --watch
  Tests/clip_bridge.py --roundtrip my-token          # what the gate runs

Received text goes to --out (default: stdout) and, with --to-clipboard, to
the host's own clipboard through wl-copy/xclip/pbpaste when present.
--dir=bi implies --to-clipboard: doing both halves means what the guest
copies has to be allowed to reach the host clipboard, and without the flag
the guest->host half silently stopped at stdout instead.
In --watch mode a lost connection is re-attached rather than fatal, so a
QEMU restart does not quietly retire the bridge.
Exit status: 0 on success, 1 on timeout or a dead connection.
