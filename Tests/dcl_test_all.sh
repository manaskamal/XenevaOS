# "Green here" is what a finished stage means: every stage ends by running
# this. Four parts, in order, each reporting `ok` or stopping with a reason:
#
#   1. tree counts  -- a file appearing or disappearing should be a decision
#                      with a number attached, not something noticed three
#                      stages later
#   2. build        -- full `make llvm`, grepped for `error:`. Worth being
#                      explicit: `make llvm | tail` reports *tail's* exit
#                      status, so pipefail alone would pass a failed build
#   3. boot         -- a complete QEMU run. Exit 124 (timeout) is the
#                      expected status; the verdict is the log
#   4. assertions   -- on that log
#
# Usage:
#   ./Tests/dcl_test_all.sh              full run
#   CLEAN=1 ./Tests/dcl_test_all.sh      `make clean` first -- required after any edit
#                                        under BaseHdr/, because KernelAA64/Makefile has
#                                        no header dependency tracking and stale objects
#                                        will silently keep old header contents
