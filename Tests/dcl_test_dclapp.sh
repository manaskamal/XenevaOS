# Tests/dcl_test_dclapp.sh -- the userspace half of the gate.
#
# Tests/dcl_test_all.sh asserts the kernel's own boot-time tests; this asserts the
# *dcltest* application, which reaches the same devices the way a real
# program does -- through devfs, with file descriptors, from Process/dcltest.
# The distinction matters: the kernel self-test reads /dev/hwrng through its
# own shim, while dcltest opens the node, reads it, and checks the bytes, so
# a cdev/registration bug that the kernel test cannot see shows up here.
#
# Pass a boot log to re-check one that already exists (that is how Tests/dcl_test_all.sh
# reuses its own run); with no argument it boots QEMU itself, in a window.
# Windowed rather than headless on purpose: headless wraps QEMU in a
# `timeout 120` that always burns the full 120s, and it hides the boot you
# would otherwise be watching. Press Enter at the resolution menu, then close
# the window to run the checks against the captured log.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Tests/dcl_test_dclapp.sh                 boot in a window and check
#   ./Tests/dcl_test_dclapp.sh <bootlog>       check an existing log
