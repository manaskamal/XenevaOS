# QEMU VHD Automation Runner

This script automates the process of detaching a Virtual Hard Disk (`.vhd` / `.vhdx`) from the Windows host, launching your custom OS kernel inside QEMU, and automatically reattaching the VHD once the QEMU emulation window is closed. 

This eliminates the manual effort of unmounting/mounting disks during operating system development.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x** must be installed and added to your system `PATH`.
2. **QEMU** must be installed, and your architecture binary (e.g., `qemu-system-aarch64`) must be accessible via your terminal.
3. **Administrator Privileges**: Windows requires elevated permissions to modify disk attachments (`diskpart`).



##  Critical Requirement: Run Visual Studio as Administrator

Because the script runs inside the Visual Studio build lifecycle, **Visual Studio itself must be running with full Administrator privileges**. If it is not, the script will fail to detach the VHD, and QEMU will crash with an "Access Denied" error.

* **How to do this:** Close Visual Studio entirely. Find your Visual Studio shortcut or executable, **Right-Click** it, and select **Run as administrator**.



## Setup Guide: Integrating with Visual Studio

Follow these steps to configure your project to run this script automatically on every successful build or have it run with any successful build of any project of your liking :
#### 1. Open properties of the project in Visual Studio.
#### 2. Navigate to the "Build Events" then "Post-Build Event".
#### 3. In the "Command Line" field, click the drop down button and select edit.
#### 4. In the Command Line editor, go to a new line and enter the following command "python $(ProjectDir)script-1.py" 
#### 5. Click "OK" to save the post-build event and then click apply.
