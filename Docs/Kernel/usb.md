# USB System in XenevaOS

The USB subsystem in XenevaOS is designed with modularity and flexibility in mind, allowing communication between higher-level applications and USB devices, as well as between the kernel and USB devices. The system is composed of three different layers running separately from each other: the __Host Controller Driver__, the __Core USB Driver__, and the __USB Class Drivers__. Each component is loaded separately by the kernel as a module to ensure clean separation and ease of development.

## Architecture Overview

- **Host Controller Driver**: The Host Controller Driver is responsible for directly interacting with the hardware. It handles tasks such as initializing the controller, managing port attach and detach events, managing endpoint descriptors, and transferring data between USB devices and USB class drivers. This driver is separate from the USB core driver to maintain a clean abstraction layer.

- **USB Core Driver**: The USB core driver acts as a glue layer between the USB class drivers and the host controller driver. It manages device enumeration, communication protocols, and standard USB operations. When a class driver requests a USB operation, the USB core driver forwards these requests to the appropriate host controller driver (e.g., xHCI).

- **USB Class Drivers**: USB class drivers implement functionality specific to certain types of USB devices, such as mass storage devices, keyboards, or audio peripherals. These drivers rely on the USB core driver for performing operations like data transfers or sending control requests.

	int (*poll_wait)(_usb_dev_* dev, int wait_type);
	usb_drv_entry ClassEntry;
	usb_drv_unload ClassUnload;
}AuUSBDevice;
#pragma pack(pop)
```

The `AuUSBDevice` structure is the primary interface through which communication between the USB class drivers, the USB core driver, and the USB host controllers takes place. Whenever a new USB device connection is detected, the host controller initializes the device and allocates a new `AuUSBDevice` structure for use by the Core driver and class drivers.
