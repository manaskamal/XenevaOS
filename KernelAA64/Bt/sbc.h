/* Encode-only SBC for A2DP (Bluetooth Advanced Audio Distribution,
 * Appendix B). Fixed production configuration, matching what every A2DP
 * sink (including Sony ULT WEAR) accepts:
 *   joint stereo, 8 subbands, 16 blocks, Loudness allocation,
 *   44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, configurable bitpool (53 = A2DP high quality).
 *
 * One frame carries 16 blocks x 8 subbands = 128 PCM samples per channel.
 * At bitpool 53 a frame is 119 bytes (~328 kbit/s at 44.1 kHz).
 *
 * Filterbank, Loudness offsets, bit allocation, CRC and packing follow the
 * A2DP spec as implemented by google/libsbc (Apache-2.0); only integer
 * <stdint.h>/<string.h> operations are used so this compiles both in the
 * kernel and in the host unit test. */
