/*
 * clipd -- the guest half of the host<->VM clipboard.
 *
 * Text crosses the virtio-console port QEMU exposes as a socket on the host
 * (127.0.0.1:43211 unless moved). A stream socket hands back whatever the
 * last write put in, with no boundaries of its own, so both ends frame it:
 *
 *     4 bytes  payload length, little endian
 *     1 byte   type -- 0 = clipboard contents, 1 = hello
 *     n bytes  payload
 *
 * The hello is why the type exists. It goes out before anything else and is
 * retried until a write reports bytes accepted, which is the only signal
 * this side has that a host is attached at all (port_fops_read answers 0 and
 * -EAGAIN alike once DCL's wrapper has mapped both to 0). Until it lands,
 * the host has no reason to send either: QEMU drops what arrives before the
 * guest's port is open, and a host that pushed first would be pushing into
 * nothing.
 *
 * The bridge is one-directional at each edge and always carries both:
 * whatever arrives is written into /dev/clipboard, and whatever appears in
 * /dev/clipboard is queued to go out. Which of the two the host acts on is
 * the host's --dir choice, so this side takes no configuration and one image
 * serves a pull-only and a bidirectional setup alike.
 *
 * Every buffer is static: main()'s stack is small, and a 4 KB scratch pair
 * would sit in it for the life of the process.
