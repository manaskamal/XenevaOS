	 * __clang__ is deliberately *not* tested above. mainline's
	 * <linux/stdarg.h> forwards here, so whichever type is typedef'd
	 * below is the one every drm source sees -- and the two drm users
	 * want opposite things from it. drm_print.c needs the builtins
	 * (clang's va_start rejects a hand-rolled pointer), and
	 * KernelAA64/Drivers/uart.c:129 needs the flat one, because
	 * `va_list args = ((va_list)reg_save_area + 8)` only compiles when
	 * va_list is a pointer it can cast and add to.
	 *
	 * XEClib's userspace copy of this header
	 * (Libs/XEClib/includes/stdarg.h) *has* moved arm-64 to the builtins,
	 * with a note naming the forwarded-va_list cases the pointer walk gets
	 * wrong. When this side follows it, the thing that has to change is
	 * uart.c's register-save-area walk -- not this typedef back and forth.
