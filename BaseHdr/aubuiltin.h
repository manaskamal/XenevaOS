/**
 * Registry of drivers that are linked into the kernel but can still be handed
 * over: a built-in driver registers the PCI function it bound, plus how to let
 * go of it (release) and how to take it back (reinit). That makes them behave
 * like loadable drivers for /dev/drvctl ("unload NAME" / "load NAME") and lets
 * /dev/hwdev refuse a PCI function a built-in driver still owns, which is what
 * allows a user-space server to take such a device over safely and the
 * supervisor to give it back.
