/* GPUSRV=1: asynchronous virtio-gpu presentation over /dev/gpusrv.
 *
 * /dev/graph maps a kernel-owned, tightly packed desktop framebuffer. It is
 * stable across server restarts and mirrored to GOP on each damage update.
 * ACQUIRE requires the caller's hwdev capability for 1af4:1050. The ABI never
 * returns a physical framebuffer address owned by the kernel: the server
 * supplies DMA backing pages allocated through its own /dev/hwdev capability.
 * TAKE copies pending damage from the stable kernel framebuffer into that
 * backing, then freezes the frame until ACK.
 * Only one frame may be in flight. New damage coalesces while it is busy.
 * The server must reset the device before ACQUIRE and close its hwdev handle
 * after any failed/timed-out command. It must never ACK unfinished device I/O.
 * The kernel never waits for the server and never frees either framebuffer.
