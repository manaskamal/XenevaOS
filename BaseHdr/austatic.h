/**
 * Static components: drivers linked into the kernel image instead of loaded
 * from a PE file at run time (the unikernel build profile, STATIC_COMPONENTS=1).
 *
 * A static component keeps the component lifecycle -- the driver manager still
 * "loads" it by name and calls its AuDriverMain -- but there is no file, no PE
 * loader, no relocation and no import resolution. The component stays resident:
 * it is never unloadable (flags == 0), so /dev/drvctl reports it as such.
