/*
 * DCL <linux/console.h> -- the console registration surface serial_core and
 * 8250 use.
 *
 * The load-bearing decision here: register_console() records a console so
 * that console_is_registered() answers true and callers stop asking -- but it
 * does *not* hand the UART over. Xeneva's boot log is written to the same
 * serial port by UARTDebugOut(), and letting mainline's uart console drive
 * those registers as well would mean two writers interleaving characters at
 * register level: a garbled console rather than a working one, and a fault
 * that would only show up under load. Native output keeps ownership; the
 * registration API is satisfied because serial_core.c:2574 calls
 * register_console() and then expects console_is_registered() to be true, and
 * because uart_add_one_port() returns through it (serial_core.c:2991, :2999).
 *
 * console_lock()/console_unlock() are the printk console semaphore. There is
 * exactly one writer here, so the lock is uncontended by construction -- but
 * they must exist as calls, because serial_core.c:2530 and tty_io.c:3589 take
 * them around tty-device lookups, and a missing symbol would take the whole
 * registration path down.
 *
 * console_suspend() is called from uart_suspend_port()/uart_resume_port();
 * Xeneva has no suspend path, so it is a no-op that keeps the call site
 * readable rather than sending anyone to find out why the symbol is missing.
 *
 * console_suspend_enabled mirrors mainline's default for a kernel without
 * CONFIG_PM_SLEEP: false. serial_core.c:2319 branches on it -- with false the
 * suspend path stops RX and returns early, which is the behaviour that makes
 * sense for a console that is never suspended.

 * port lock.  Answering the same thing twice under two names is fine;
