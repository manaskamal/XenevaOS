/*
 * DCL <linux/bitops.h> -- bit arithmetic.
 *
 * tty_buffer.c includes this for one thing: __ALIGN_MASK(), which rounds a
 * requested buffer length up to the next 256-byte boundary
 * (`size = __ALIGN_MASK(size, TTYB_ALIGN_MASK)` at tty_buffer.c:172). That
 * rounding is what lets the free list work at all -- a recycled buffer is only
 * reused when the new request is <= MIN_TTYB_SIZE, and both sides have to
 * agree on the granularity or a 257-byte request silently gets a 256-byte
 * buffer.
 *
 * <linux/kernel.h> already has the same operation spelled __ALIGN_KERNEL_MASK
 * with an extra typeof() cast; __ALIGN_MASK is mainline's name for it, kept
 * here rather than in kernel.h because nothing outside a ported file has ever
 * asked for that spelling.
 *
 * The bit-search helpers used to be deliberately absent, on the grounds that
 * no file in the staged tty/serial set called them. drm_drv.c:574 now does --
 * for_each_set_bit() over the wedge-recovery bitmask in drm_dev_wedged_event()
 * -- so they are here, and the reasoning is restated rather than deleted: a
 * bitmap search still has no caller that would notice how it is implemented,
 * only one that needs the right bit number back. The loops below are a linear
 * walk; mainline's find_next_bit() reads a word at a time and skips whole
 * zero words. That difference is invisible at the one call site, whose
 * bitmap is a single unsigned long, and would stop being invisible the day a
 * driver scans a large mask in a hot path -- at which point the word-wise
 * version belongs here, not a faster loop over the same array.
 */

/*
 * BITS_PER_LONG and DECLARE_BITMAP sit above the kernel.h include, which is
 * not where either would naturally go. kernel.h pulls in a wide subtree
 * (virtio.h, completion.h, wait.h, sched.h) and nodemask_types.h sits at the
 * far end of it, already using DECLARE_BITMAP(bits, MAX_NUMNODES). By the time
 * that chain reaches it this header's own include guard is set, so
 * nodemask_types.h's #include <linux/bitops.h> is a no-op and a definition
 * placed below would not have been seen. Defining them first is what makes
 * that chain parse.
 *
 * For DECLARE_BITMAP that is also the only order that works, not merely one
 * that does: <linux/bitmap.h> includes this header at its top, so a file
 * starting there arrives with DECLARE_BITMAP undefined and bitmap.h's own copy
 * -- mainline's home for it -- not yet reached. It has to live here.
 *
 * BITS_PER_LONG is a fallback only -- <linux/kernel.h> also defines it. Kept
 * in step with kernel.h (sizeof(long)*8, not 64): this target is LLP64, see
 * the note there for what a hardcoded 64 does to the word index and the shift
 * below.

 * does need the distinction should not find half the family missing.
 *
 * __ffs() is index-of-first-set-bit, and mainline documents the answer as
 * undefined for a word of 0: drm_mm.c:1887 calls it on `last + 1`, which the
 * surrounding loop has already established is non-zero. __builtin_ctzl is
 * what mainline's generic version reaches for as well; `long` is 32 bits on
 * this target and the builtin follows the type, so the width is right.

 * already arrives directly in most of them, but drm_cache.c,
 * drm_plane_helper.c and drm_probe_helper.c never include it, and WARN_ONCE

 * it too, so one include here covers all fifteen objects. bug.h's own
 * <asm/bug.h> walks on to <linux/kernel.h>, whose guard the include at the
 * top of this file already spent; by the time this line runs that is a
 * no-op.
 *
 * le32_to_cpup is drm_format_helper.c's pointer load (drm_format_helper.c:
 * 265-268 and the xfrm line helpers below them). mainline gets it from
 * <linux/kernel.h>:38 including <asm/byteorder.h>; DCL's kernel.h does not
 * carry that include, and drm_format_helper.c reaches the byteorder layer
 * through nothing else. Pulling <asm/byteorder.h> in here would also work,
 * but it would put generic.h's object-like le16_to_cpu()/cpu_to_le16()
 * definitions in front of the function-like ones <linux/types.h>:129
 * already publishes, turning six -Wmacro-redefined warnings into a line in
 * every object this tree builds. Only the one name is needed, so only the
 * one name is defined -- spelled exactly as generic.h:101 spells it, so a
 * file that reaches generic.h afterwards sees an identical redefinition and
 * no warning. The uapi header supplies the static inline __le32_to_cpup()
 * the alias points at, and is already part of every include chain that saw
