/*
 * DCL <linux/interrupt.h> -- request_irq()/free_irq() over Xeneva's GIC.
 *
 * The GIC already keeps a per-SPI callback table (KernelAA64/Hal/gic.c:
 * GICRegisterSPIHandler / GICCallSPIHandler, typed void (*)(int spi)), so the
 * adapter is small: record (irq -> handler, dev_id) and install one dispatcher
 * as that SPI's handler. Bodies land in DCL/linux_irq_shim.c.
 *
 * IRQ numbers: this is where a faithful adapter earns its keep. On ARM64 the
 * GIC numbers SGIs 0-15, PPIs 16-31 and SPIs from 32, and Linux's irq number
 * on these boards is the HW irq, so the SPI id is irq - 32. A negative result
 * means somebody asked for an SGI/PPI -- a per-CPU line no serial driver owns
 * -- and is refused rather than quietly registered on the wrong vector.
 *
 * One handler per irq. IRQF_SHARED is accepted because 8250_port.c:2314 sets
 * it unconditionally for iotype PORT_UNKNOWN, but nothing in this tree shares
 * an irq yet: a fabricated share list would be the kind of quiet wrongness
 * that surfaces later as a lost interrupt. If a second driver ever asks, that
 * is the moment to grow it.
 *
 * irqreturn_t and IRQ_NONE/IRQ_HANDLED/IRQ_WAKE_THREAD come from
 * <linux/irqreturn.h> through <linux/kernel.h> now, as do the delay
 * primitives -- see <linux/delay.h>.  IRQ_RETVAL is that header's too, so
 * this file no longer restates it with a second spelling.

/*
 * mainline's <linux/interrupt.h> includes <linux/irqflags.h>, and the reason
 * it does is <drm/drm_util.h>:64 -- drm_can_sleep() calls irqs_disabled()
 * without naming the header it comes from, so the include has to be here for
 * the vendored drm code to resolve.  DCL's irqflags.h is one honest DAIF read.
