 *
 * READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE are the "one access, no compiler cleverness" pair.
 * The tty code needs them structurally rather than for performance:
 * tty_buffer.c:64 reads buf->flip_wq with READ_ONCE() before handing it to a
 * work function, and the acquire/release forms around commit/next (lines 489,
 * 522, 290, 296) are what stop the producer's store of the byte *before* the
 * cursor from being observed after the cursor itself. On a uniprocessor with
 * no compiler reordering across a volatile access that would already hold --
 * but volatile is not an ordering primitive, so these are built on __atomic
 * with the right ordering instead of on volatile casts. The distinction costs
 * nothing and keeps the header honest if DCL ever runs on more than one core.
 *
 * smp_load_acquire/smp_store_release take pointers of any type, which is why
 * they are macros over __atomic_load_n/__atomic_store_n rather than
 * typed inlines: they are called on both unsigned int* (head->commit) and
 * struct tty_buffer** (head->next).

 * strscpy(dst, src[, count]) -- mainline's two-form spelling of the above.
 *
 * mainline dispatches on the argument count rather than overloading, because
 * C cannot overload and this tree has both shapes in it at once:
 *
 *   virtio_console.c:1635   strscpy(port->name, ..., sizeof(port->name));
 *   serial_core.c:2485      strscpy(address, "*unknown*", sizeof(address));
 *   drm_client.c:253        strscpy(fb->comm, client->name, TASK_COMM_LEN);
 *   drm_modes.c:2322        strscpy(cmdline_mode->name, mode->name,
 *                                   sizeof(cmdline_mode->name));
 *   drm_framebuffer.c:886   strscpy(fb->comm, current->comm);
 *
 * The last line is what made this necessary. Against the plain 3-argument
 * function this file used to carry, it reported "too few arguments to
 * function call, expected 3, have 2" -- and adding a default parameter was
 * not the fix, because mainline's rule is that the 2-argument form is only
 * valid when dst *is* an array whose size is known, and the count then comes
 * from sizeof(dst). The four 3-argument sites pass a count that is not the
 * whole array (a TASK_COMM_LEN into a longer field), which is the other half
 * of why the argument cannot simply be dropped.
 *
 * The dispatch is mainline's in shape and different in mechanism, and the
 * difference is worth recording: mainline selects with COUNT_ARGS() over a
 * padded argument list, which needs the __ARG_PLACEHOLDER machinery for the
 * empty case. Checked rather than assumed, clang counts an empty __VA_ARGS__
 * as *one* empty argument, so the padded-list version selects the 3-argument
 * arm for a 2-argument call and then complains that its size argument is
 * missing.
 *
 * __VA_OPT__ is direct about the same question. __strscpy_sel returns its
 * middle argument; the first __VA_OPT__ supplies "the count, then the
 * 3-argument arm" only when a count was actually written, and when it was
 * not, the slot that __VA_OPT__ left empty is precisely the middle one --
 * which lands on __strscpy_2. __strscpy_2 is variadic so the trailing empty
 * __VA_ARGS__ that strscpy() passes has somewhere to go.
 *
 * Both arms are always parsed, so dst is sizeof'd even on the 3-argument
 * path; that is harmless and is the price of picking the arm after expansion
 * rather than before.
