/*
 * DCL <linux/string.h> -- memcpy/memset/memcmp and friends.
 *
 * These are Xeneva's own routines (BaseHdr/string.h), not mainline's lib/:
 * the tty layer copies into and out of flip buffers with them, and a second
 * implementation would only be a second thing to get right. Mainline includes
 * <linux/string.h> for the same reason -- to see the prototypes -- so the
 * header exists to resolve the include and nothing more.
 *
 * tty_buffer.c's use is exactly memcpy() into char_buf_ptr(), memset() over
 * the flags byte for a run of same-flagged characters, and the zeroing of
 * consumed bytes in receive_buf() so a buffer can be handed on.
 *
 * The DRM/KMS stage then made this header carry real content, all of it for
 * callers that reach no other string header:
 *
 *   - strnchr, str_has_prefix, mem_is_zero and strtomem_pad, which mainline
 *     keeps here. drm_modes.c parses the video= command line with the first
 *     two, drm_edid.c asks whether a 128-byte block is all zero, and
 *     drm_connector.c:614-615 copies an HDMI vendor/product string into a
 *     fixed-width, possibly non-NUL-terminated field.
 *
 *   - str_yes_no, re-exported from <linux/string_choices.h> rather than
 *     copied. drm_edid.c:6319 prints an HDMI capability as yes/no and
 *     includes neither that header nor <linux/string_helpers.h>, its other
 *     carrier in this tree. Copying the body would collide with the header
 *     in the files that do include it -- two static definitions of the same
 *     name in one translation unit is not a warning.
 *
 *   - strscpy_pad and scnprintf as declarations only, with bodies in
 *     DCL/linux_math_shim.c. Both need something this header cannot supply:
 *     strscpy_pad's error return is -E2BIG, which kernel.h:281 defines
 *     *after* it includes this file at :121, so an inline here cannot be
 *     parsed in every kernel.h-initiated chain; scnprintf must reach
 *     _vsnprintf's va_list plumbing (<Log/_print.h>, KernelAA64's own
 *     header). A declaration is all the call sites need either way.

 *
 * The difference from strchr() is the whole reason drm_modes.c uses it
 * (drm_modes.c:2302, :2390, :2392, :2396): the string being searched is a
 * slice of a larger command-line buffer -- the connector name before the
 * ':' or '-' or '@' separators -- and it is *not* NUL-terminated at the
 * point the caller cares about. `name_end`/`options_off` are how long that
 * slice is. A plain strchr() would run past the slice into the rest of the
 * option string and report the separator belonging to a later field, so
 * `video=HDMI-A-1:1280x720@60` would be read as a name that itself contains
 * '@'. mainline's body is this loop in lib/string.c; count is decremented
 * before the NUL test so `count == 0` answers NULL rather than reading s.

 *
 *     ret = str_has_prefix(name, mode->name);
 *     if (ret != name_end)
 *             continue;
 *
 * where `name` is the unbounded slice and `name_end` its measured length, so
 * the comparison is "starts with mode->name *and* is exactly that long". A
 * strncmp-style 0/1 answer would compare `1 != name_end` and every named
 * mode would be rejected except a one-character one. strncmp is bounded by

 * memchr_inv and the block is 128 bytes on a cold path, so the plain byte

 * strtomem_pad(dest, src, pad) -- copy the NUL-terminated `src` into the

 *
 * drm_connector.c:614-615 is the call:
 *
 *     strtomem_pad(connector->hdmi.vendor, vendor, 0);
 *     strtomem_pad(connector->hdmi.product, product, 0);
 *
 * where the fields are `unsigned char vendor[DRM_CONNECTOR_HDMI_VENDOR_LEN]
 * __nonstring` (drm_connector.h:1933) -- HDMI 2.1 wants them fixed-width with
 * no NUL, and a bytes-typed readout must see the padding rather than
 * whatever the struct held before. The source strings come from userspace
 * through the connector init path and are not guaranteed to be shorter than
 * the field, so the copy must stop at sizeof(dest) without reading the
 * source past it -- the loop below reads src[i] only while i < dest_len,
 * which is strnlen(src, dest_len)'s guarantee without needing a strnlen DCL
 * does not carry.
 *
 * The helper is a real inline and the macro supplies sizeof(dest) and the
 * compile-time array check: dest is an array, not a pointer, and the size is
 * not an argument (same contract as mainline's strtomem_pad).
 * __must_be_array(dest) is the check -- its _Static_assert stops the build
 * for a pointer, where sizeof would silently be the pointer's size and the
 * copy would truncate -- but its *value* is not part of the length here.
 * mainline adds it (it folds to 0 on GNU/Linux), and on this target it does
 * not: aarch64-unknown-windows gives an empty struct -- the shape
 * __BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO_MSG folds to -- size 4, so
 * `sizeof(dest) + __must_be_array(dest)` made every copy run 4 bytes past
 * the field until the check was split onto its own line. The do/while is
 * mainline's shape too; both call sites are statements.
