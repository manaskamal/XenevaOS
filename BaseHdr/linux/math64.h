/*
 * DCL <linux/math64.h> -- 64-bit division and 32x32->64 multiplication.
 *
 * Every body below is the generic C answer (`/`, `%`, `(u64)a * b`) rather
 * than an arch-specific routine, and that is the correct answer here rather
 * than a simplification: this target is aarch64, which has a hardware 64-bit
 * divider and a 32x32->64 multiplier (umulh), so each of these compiles to
 * one instruction pair with no libgcc call -- the exact problem upstream's
 * per-arch split (lib/div64.c and the per-arch lib directories) exists to
 * avoid on 32-bit CPUs that trap or soft-divide. Matching mainline's
 * *answers* is all that is owed, and for truncating integer division the
 * hardware and the reference agree bit for bit, including the signed
 * forms' round-toward-zero.
 *
 * include <linux/types.h> supplies u64/s64/u32/s32 (kernel.h's typedefs) so
 * the prototypes read like mainline's. The include is safe in either
 * direction: types.h's own kernel.h include is behind kernel.h's include
 * guard, which any caller of this header has already set, and asm/div64.h
 * has pulled types.h in before its bottom include of this file.
 *
 * Not every consumer names this header. drm_mm.c, drm_file.c, drm_rect.c,
 * drm_format_helper.c and drm_fourcc.c reach it only through
 * <asm/div64.h>, which includes it at the bottom -- see the bridge note
 * there. That is why the helpers must be inline here and not in a DCL shim:
 * a definition the caller cannot see is not a definition.

 * div64_u64 / DIV64_U64_ROUND_UP -- the one pair this header carried for the

 *
 *     temp *= NSEC_PER_SEC;
 *     port->frame_time = (unsigned int)DIV64_U64_ROUND_UP(temp, baud);
 *
 * which turns a bit time into the nanoseconds a whole frame takes, rounded
 * *up* because a frame time that rounds down would make uart_poll_timeout()
 * wake before the last stop bit had left the wire -- the caller then polls
 * once more and, on a slow line, can poll forever.  Rounding up is the safe
 * direction and it is what upstream's div64_u64() does behind this macro.
 * Written as a macro rather than an inline for the same reachability reason
 * as the rest, just at an earlier stage: serial_core.c happened to include
 * the header, and a plain expression cannot disagree with itself.

 * kHz-with-decimals without floating point. 1000000000UL fits unsigned long
 * on this LLP64 target (32 bits) with room to spare, and `a` is a mode clock
 * in kHz, so the only input that would fault is zero -- which no parsed
