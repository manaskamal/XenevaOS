/*
 * DCL <linux/lib/cmdline.h> -- kernel command-line parsing.
 *
 * mainline keeps get_option() and get_options() in lib/cmdline.c and declares
 * them here; get_cmdline() is the odd one out, living in fs/exec.c and
 * declared here all the same. Same split here, with the bodies in
 * DCL/linux_cmdline_shim.c.
 *
 * Declarations rather than static inlines, and that is forced rather than
 * stylistic: the only caller is lib/string_helpers.c:146-154, whose include
 * list (slab.h, string.h, string_helpers.h) does not reach this header. An
 * implicit declaration there compiles -- the tree downgrades
 * -Wimplicit-function-declaration to a warning -- but a static inline emits no
 * symbol, so the two calls would link against nothing. An extern definition
 * works whether or not the caller can see the header.
 *
 * The calling convention is worth reading before the bodies:
 *
 *     get_options(buf, 0, &nints);          // count only
 *     if (!nints)
 *         return -ENOENT;
 *     ints = kzalloc_objs(*ints, nints + 1);
 *     get_options(buf, nints + 1, ints);    // now parse for real
 *
 * `nints` there is an int passed *as the ints array*, not as a count. That is
 * mainline's contract, not a slip in the caller: get_options() writes the
 * number of values it collected into ints[0] and the values after it, so an
 * uninitialized local comes back holding the count. With nints == 0 it counts
 * without writing past ints[0], which is why the first call can hand it a
 * pointer to a single int.
