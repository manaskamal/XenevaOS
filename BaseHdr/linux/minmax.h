/*
 * DCL <linux/minmax.h> -- min/max/min_t/max_t/clamp/ARRAY_SIZE.
 *
 * Every definition here is guarded *and* token-identical to the copies already
 * in <linux/kernel.h> and <linux/mm.h>, because those two define min() and
 * ARRAY_SIZE() themselves (mm.h guards, kernel.h does not). Two headers
 * spelling the same macro differently is a -Wmacro-redefined warning at best
 * and, for ARRAY_SIZE, a mismatch in parameter names that the preprocessor
 * counts as a real difference. Matching exactly means whichever header loads
 * first wins silently -- which is what the tty_buffer.c include list, with
 * both <linux/minmax.h> and <linux/mm.h> reachable, needs.
 *
 * min_t()/max_t() do the cast *before* the comparison; that is the whole
 * point, and it is what tty_buffer.c:315 relies on when it writes
 * `min_t(size_t, size - copied, TTY_BUFFER_PAGE)` -- without the cast, an
 * int and a size_t would be compared under the usual arithmetic conversions
 * and a negative difference would wrap to a huge unsigned value.

 * `MAX_T(int, DRM_COLOR_ENCODING_MAX, ret)`, which clamps a driver's

 * drm_crtc.c:688 swaps two `int` display dimensions before the clipping
 * arithmetic (a rotated primary plane is checked in the axes the framebuffer
 * is sampled on, not the ones the mode is stated in), while vkms_formats.c
 * swaps __u16 pixel components at :267 and u64 fixed-point matrix entries at
 * :867-869. A typed helper would force a cast at two of the three.
 *
 * do/while(0) rather than a bare comma expression, because swap() is a
 * statement and mainline spells it that way: `if (rotated) swap(a, b);
 * else ...` has to stay one statement. Same shape as assign_bit() in
 * bitops.h and WRITE_ONCE() in kernel.h.
