/*
 * DCL <linux/pm_runtime.h> -- the four runtime-PM calls 8250_port.c makes,
 * plus pm_wakeup_event().
 *
 * Runtime PM asks "may this device's power/clock be cut, and when did it last
 * do something".  Xeneva manages no device power: there is no PM domain, no
 * reference-counted clock, no autosuspend timer, and DCL's UART console must
 * not have its clock cut under it.  So the get/put pair is deliberately
 * *neutral* -- get succeeds, put does nothing -- rather than pretending to
 * count references.  A get that failed would make 8250_port.c bail out of
 * serial8250_start_tx() and serial8250_rx_dma() with -EACCES, i.e. a driver
 * that refuses to transmit; a get that succeeds and a put that does nothing
 * is what an always-on device does, which is what this is.
 *
 * The call sites tell the same story: pm_runtime_get_sync() at
 * 8250_port.c:519/655 guards "device is awake" on the way into transmit,
 * pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() + pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() at :527/:668
 * record activity and request idle on the way out.  With nothing to suspend,
 * the only part that matters is that none of them returns an error.
 *
 * pm_wakeup_event() lives in linux/pm_wakeup.h upstream; DCL has no wakeup
 * source registry either, so it sits here next to the other PM no-ops rather
 * than earning a header of its own.
 *

 * -- "runtime PM off, or the device is already up, then transmit".  Answering
 * enabled = 1 here would have made the second half load-bearing, and a
 * `pm_runtime_active` that said "yes" would be claiming a power state DCL
 * does not track; saying *disabled* is both the truth (nothing ever enabled
 * it) and the answer that makes mainline's own disjunct do the right thing,
 * because !0 short-circuits straight to start_tx.  A device with no runtime
 * PM is always usable, which is exactly what the first arm means.
 *
 * The wakeup family is DCL's answer for the same reason: no device is
 * wake-capable, so device_may_wakeup() is 0 and the enable/disable arms
 * around it -- which would arm the GIC to wake the SoC -- are never reached.
 * device_may_wakeup() still tolerates a NULL dev, because serial_core.c:2383
 * calls it on the result of device_find_child() with no NULL check.
