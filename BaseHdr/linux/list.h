 *
 * LANDMINE, recorded so nobody has to rediscover it: Xeneva's own
 * <list.h> -- a different, older API over `list_t` -- also exports a
 * `list_add(list_t*, void*)`, and the two cannot be declared in one
 * translation unit (they are both `list_add`, with different arguments; C
 * has no overload). Nothing in the ported tty/serial set includes that
 * header, so they coexist in the tree -- but a file that needs Xeneva's
 * process/socket/network headers *and* a mainline list has to be split in
 * two, or one of the two APIs renamed. DCL/linux_irq_shim.c takes the first
 * route: the thread name it publishes in dcl_current() is fetched by
 * DCL/current_ident.c, the one native-header TU, because
 * <Hal/AA64/sched.h> (pthread merge, ad87f135) pulls <list.h> in just as
 * <process.h> does.
 *
 * list_del() is deliberately idempotent: it clears the node and a second
 * remove on an already-removed node is a no-op rather than a write through
 * stale pointers. Mainline poisons the node instead, to catch the bug -- a
 * reasonable trade when a mistake trips a debug kernel, but the wrong one
 * here, where a doubly-removed wait entry would corrupt a queue that nothing
 * else is checking, on a system with no lock protecting it either way.
