/*
 * DCL <linux/hrtimer.h> -- the two RS485 turnaround timers 8250_port.c owns.
 *
 * This header exists because struct serial8250_em485 embeds two struct
 * hrtimer BY VALUE (serial_8250.h:126-127), so the type has to be complete at
 * the point of declaration -- and mainline reaches it there by accident, not
 * by listing it: upstream's serial_8250.h includes errno/serial_core/
 * serial_reg/platform_device and nothing that names hrtimer, so struct
 * hrtimer is complete only because serial_core.h -> sched.h happens to drag it
 * in. DCL's serial_core.h is assembled from mainline but its include list is
 * the subset BaseHdr actually has, so the dependency is written down in
 * serial_8250.h instead of arriving by side effect.
 *
 * WHAT THESE DO, AND WHAT THEY DO NOT
 * -----------------------------------
 * hrtimer_start() records the target time and sets a pending flag. It does
 * NOT queue anything, and no callback ever fires from it.
 *
 * That is not a placeholder chosen because it was quick: Xeneva runs no timer
 * interrupt at all, which is already documented at the top of
 * <linux/timer.h> -- there is no tick to count jiffies, so `extern jiffies`
 * would link to a word that never moves, and DCL reads the same counter
 * udelay() burns against instead. With no tick there is no place to run a
 * timer queue from, and <linux/timer.h>'s add_timer()/mod_timer() have the
 * same contract today: set pending, do not schedule, with the queue left as a
 * TODO for whoever brings up real deferred work. These functions are the same
 * contract, written in ktime rather than jiffies, so the two halves of DCL's
 * timer story do not disagree.
 *
 * The consequence, stated plainly because it is a real limitation and not a
 * formality: serial8250_em485_handle_stop_tx()/..._handle_start_tx() never
 * run, so the delay between "shift from TX to RX" and "shift back" is never
 * applied. That delay exists to let the last stop bit leave the wire before
 * the driver flips an RS485 transceiver's direction pin.
 *
 * Why that costs nothing today: these two timers are armed only by
 * serial8250_em485_init(), which is called only from
 * serial8250_em485_config() -- the generic ->rs485_config() callback, i.e.
 * the handler for TIOCSRS485. No port DCL opens is put into RS485 mode, so
 * p->em485 is NULL, the em485 code paths are not entered, and nothing is
 * waiting for a callback that will not come. If a stage ahead does bring up
 * RS485 (an iMX8MP or RPi transceiver is exactly the hardware this is for),
 * this header is the thing to replace -- not the drivers, which are already
 * calling the right functions with the right arguments.
 *
 * Struct layout is DCL's own: 8250_port.c never touches a field of struct
 * hrtimer, it only calls hrtimer_setup/start/cancel/try_to_cancel and returns
 * HRTIMER_NORESTART from the callbacks, so nothing here needs to agree with
 * mainline's node/expires layout. See <linux/serial_core.h> for why the same
 * freedom is NOT taken with struct uart_port -- that one is laid out by
 * designated initialisers in the driver, field by field.
