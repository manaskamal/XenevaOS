/*
 * DCL <linux/idr.h> -- struct ida and the small allocation API.
 *
 * virtio-rng.c uses exactly two things from it:
 *
 *     static DEFINE_IDA(rng_index_ida);
 *     vi->index = ida_alloc(&rng_index_ida, GFP_KERNEL);
 *     ...
 *     ida_free(&rng_index_ida, index);
 *
 * the index being used to name the device ("virtio-<n>"). mainline gets to
 * this header by accident of its include graph -- there is no idr.h among the
 * driver's own includes. The chain, confirmed against the header package:
 *
 *     linux/virtio.h -> linux/device.h -> linux/kobject.h
 *                  -> linux/sysfs.h     -> linux/kernfs.h -> linux/idr.h
 *
 * DCL has no device.h (that chain is why <linux/virtio.h> here also pulls in
 * completion.h and pm.h), so virtio.h includes this file directly instead of
 * walking five headers to reach the same place. The driver's own #include
 * list is therefore untouched, which is what has to stay true.
 *
 * ### struct ida is a placeholder, and the shim's counter is the real one
 *
 * mainline's is `struct ida { struct xarray xa; }` -- a radix tree of ID
 * bitmaps, because a kernel hands out millions of them. DCL's
 * ida_alloc_range() (linux_kmod_shim.c) ignores the object entirely and keeps
 * a single static counter in the function, which is enough for the one ida in
 * the tree and for whatever else shows up while DCL has no IDA users at all.
 *
 * So this struct exists to give callers the name mainline writes, and to
 * keep `ida_alloc(&rng_index_ida, ...)` type-correct end to end. Its single
 * member is documentation, not state -- nothing reads it, and writing it
 * would be misleading. If a second ida ever needs its own numbering, the
 * counter moves in here and this comment goes with it.

/*
 * struct idr -- DCL's is a fixed slot table; mainline's is a radix tree.
 *
 * The drm core hangs three of these off a device (mode_config object/tile
 * ids, GEM object names) and one off every open file (GEM handles), and all
 * it asks of them is "give me an int in [base, base+N) and give it back as a
 * pointer".  A 64-slot array answers that directly; what it does not answer
 * is the two things mainline's tree buys -- ids beyond 64 at once, and
 * lock-free lookup.  Both are noted where they would bite:
 * idr_alloc() (DCL/linux_idr_shim.c) returns -ENOSPC rather than growing, and
 * rcu_read_lock() is a no-op, so the "lockless idr_find" mainline documents
 * is simply single-threaded here like every other DCL lock.
 *
 * idr_init_base()/idr_init()/idr_is_empty() are static inline over these
 * fields, mirroring mainline (idr.h:152-181), so a `struct idr` member in
 * drm_file.h or drm_mode_config.h is complete without a shim call.
