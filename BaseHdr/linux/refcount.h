 * DCL <linux/refcount.h> -- mainline's saturating refcount, over DCL's atomics.
 *
 * Why this exists at all: BaseHdr/drm/ is 101 byte-ports of mainline headers,
 * and struct kref in mainline holds a refcount_t. drm_connector.c:1070 does
 * not merely call a kref helper -- it reaches inside the struct and writes
 *
 *     if (!refcount_dec_and_test(&conn->base.refcount.refcount))
 *             return;
 *
 * so the field has to be a refcount_t and this header has to provide the
 * operations. DCL's own kref.h had the field as atomic_t, which is the older
 * mainline layout; kref.h is rewritten below to match mainline's, and
 * atomic_t stays as it is because tty/serial code uses it directly as a
 * counter, not as a reference count.
 *
 * Saturation is the whole reason refcount_t is not just atomic_t, and it is
 * kept here rather than simplified away. A wrapped reference count turns a
 * live object into a freed one (or the reverse), and it does so silently,
 * long after the mistake that caused it. Saturating trades that for a
 * permanently stuck counter, which is at least loud in the debugger and
 * cannot be mistaken for a working object.
 *
 * Two differences from mainline's implementation, neither semantic:
 *
 *   - Ordering. Mainline picks relaxed/release/acquire per operation to save
 *     instructions. Every DCL atomic is __ATOMIC_SEQ_CST, which is stronger
 *     than all three, so the guarantees mainline documents hold here; the
 *     per-operation ordering simply is not spelled out because there is one
 *     ordering and it is the strong one.
 *
 *   - The fetch-and-return forms. Mainline uses atomic_fetch_add_relaxed()
 *     and atomic_fetch_sub_release(), which return the value *before* the
 *     operation. DCL's atomic_add_return()/atomic_sub_return() return the
 *     value after, so the before-value is recovered by adding/subtracting i
 *     back. Same number, different arithmetic.
 *
 * refcount_dec_not_one() is not ported. Mainline declares it extern with the
 * body in lib/refcount.c, and its only caller in this tree was
 * drm_gem_shmem_helper.c, which is not vendored (see Vendored/README.md for
 * why). It can be added with that caller.
