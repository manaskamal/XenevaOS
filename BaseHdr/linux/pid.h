/*
 * DCL pid.h -- the pid surface drm_file.c names.
 *
 * mainline splits this across <linux/pid_types.h> (enum pid_type) and
 * <linux/pid.h> (struct pid and the accessors), and it reaches drm_file.c
 * because mainline's <linux/fs.h> includes <linux/pid.h> (fs.h:20). DCL's
 * fs.h is pinned and includes nothing, so the whole surface lands in
 * <linux/file.h> with the rest of the vocabulary fs.h owes the drm set --
 * see the note at the top of that header for why file.h is that carrier.
 *
 * Both halves are in this one file because nothing else in the tree needs
 * either, and a header holding a five-value enum and four functions is not
 * worth splitting the way mainline splits it: the split exists there so
 * <linux/types.h> can carry the enum, and no source here reaches the enum
 * that way.
 *
 * There is no pid table, and that is the fact everything below follows from.
 * DCL identifies a task by the scheduler context dcl_current() hands back
 * (<linux/sched.h>), not by a number, so there is no pid for a task to
 * report and no table to look one up in.
