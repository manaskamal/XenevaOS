/*
 * DCL <linux/kfifo.h> -- the byte ring behind a tty port's transmit buffer.
 *
 * serial_core.c keeps everything waiting to go out the UART in one of these:
 * tty_port_alloc_xmit_buf() hands it a PAGE_SIZE buffer (serial_core.c:262),
 * uart_write() pushes bytes in, and the driver's start_tx pulls them out and
 * writes them to the shift register. 8250_port.c:1722 decides when to raise a
 * write wakeup by comparing kfifo_len() against WAKEUP_CHARS, so the length
 * has to be exact or the tty never learns the port drained.
 *
 * Deliberate simplification: mainline's kfifo is a macro-generated type-safe
 * family with a __kfifo core, a mask for power-of-two indexing, and record
 * variants for framed data. None of that is needed for a byte ring -- and
 * mainline's own `size` must be a power of two, which a macro cannot check.
 * This implementation indexes with `% size` instead: one division per byte on
 * a 115200-baud transmit path is nothing, and it cannot be wrong if a future
 * caller passes a size that is not a power of two. The `in`/`out` counters
 * free-run and wrap, so occupancy is `in - out` in plain unsigned arithmetic.
 *
 * The subset is exactly what the staged set calls: kfifo_init, kfifo_reset,
 * kfifo_is_empty, kfifo_len, kfifo_avail, kfifo_put, kfifo_in. kfifo_get and
 * kfifo_out were absent for two stages on the grounds that nothing read
 * through this ring; stage 3 changed that, and serial_core.h now reads it
 * three ways (uart_fifo_out, uart_fifo_get, uart_xmit_advance), so all three
 * are at the bottom of this file.

/*
 * The three reads serial_core.h asks for and this header did not have.
 *
 * mainline spells all three as macros built on __kfifo_out with an element
 * size; DCL's struct kfifo is byte-oriented (no esize field, `size` is a byte
 * capacity), so the bodies are plain byte loops below -- same three
 * behaviours, which is what the callers actually depend on:
 *
 *   kfifo_out(f, buf, n)     copy out and *consume* up to n bytes
 *   kfifo_get(f, val)        copy out and consume exactly one byte; the count
 *                            it returns is 0 or 1, which is why
 *                            uart_fifo_get() can add it straight to
 *                            icount.tx as "one more byte left the fifo"
 *   kfifo_skip_count(f, n)   consume without copying, for
 *                            uart_xmit_advance() -- the transmit path has
 *                            already accounted for the bytes it handed to the
 *                            UART and only needs the ring to move on
 *
 * The clamp to kfifo_len() matters in all three: mainline's variants return
 * short rather than reading past the consumer mark, and a ring that could be
 * asked for more than it holds would otherwise wrap and re-deliver bytes.
 *
 * out is a free-running counter here (kfifo_len is `in - out`, taken mod
 * `size` on access), so advancing it needs no mask -- the same convention the
 * two writers above already use for `in`.
