 * module_driver() -- mainline's bus-driver registration helper (upstream:

 * DCL pieces are built on:
 *
 *   - the init function it generates is named __driver##_init, taking the
 *     driver variable's name; module_init then stamps that name into
 *     __dcl_initcall_<...>_init, the name DclRunInitcalls() (DCL/
 *     linux_mm_shim.c) calls. drm_module.h's
 *     drm_module_pci_driver_if_modeset(bochs_pci_driver, bochs_modeset)
 *     therefore produces __dcl_initcall_bochs_pci_driver_init.
 *
 *   - it takes the registration function as a macro argument and calls it
 *     with the driver, so drm_module.h can slip the
 *     drm_firmware_drivers_only() test between module_init and
 *     pci_register_driver without this header knowing about DRM.
 *
 * Mainline also generates an exit half (__driver##_exit -> __unregister) and
 * passes it to module_exit(). DCL has no unload and module_exit above is
 * empty, so that half would be a static function with no reference --
 * -Wunused-function on every build. Dropped rather than silenced; it returns
 * with module_exit() if unloading ever exists.

/*
 * module_param_named() / module_param() / MODULE_PARM_DESC() -- no-ops, for
 * the same reason MODULE_LICENSE() above is.
 *
 * mainline's module_param_named(name, value, type, perm) *declares* nothing:
 * `value` must already exist as a variable in the file, and the macro only
 * arranges for a boot-time setter and a sysfs entry to reach it. That is why
 * this can be empty without breaking compilation -- vkms_drv.c writes
 *
 *     static bool enable_cursor = true;
 *     module_param_named(enable_cursor, enable_cursor, bool, 0444);
 *
 * where the declaration on the first line is what the compiler sees and the
 * second contributes nothing to it. The five vkms params are then read as
 * plain statics, so their compiled behaviour is exactly their initialisers:
 * cursor and writeback on, overlay and plane-pipeline off, default device
 * created. Those defaults match mainline's, because mainline's defaults are
 * the initialisers and not the parameter machinery.
 *
 * What is given up is the ability to change them: no boot argument, no
 * /sys/module/<name>/parameters/. vkms is built into the image rather than
 * loaded, so there is no module directory to hang a sysfs entry off, and
 * nothing in this tree passes kernel command-line arguments to a driver.
 * A driver that needs a runtime-configurable option has to reach for DCL's
 * own config surface instead of this one.
 *
 * module_param() is the same macro with the variable named for itself, and
 * both expand `value` in the no-op so a caller writing a complex expression
 * there still gets a compile error rather than silent acceptance.
