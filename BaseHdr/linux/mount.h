/*
 * Two mainline headers, neither of which mainline's own mount.h carries. They
 * come in here because this file is where drm_drv.c already reaches the
 * mainline fs.h surface that DCL's pinned <linux/fs.h> cannot hold --
 * simple_pin_fs(), simple_release_fs() and unmap_mapping_range() below are all
 * mainline fs.h functions, and the pinned fs.h is an ABI blob of struct
 * layouts with no room to declare them.
 *
 * drm_drv.c names this header directly (drm_drv.c:36) and that is the only
 * route into it in the whole drm set: drm_device.h includes it too, but
 * behind `#ifdef CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE` (drm_device.h:5), which is off.
 * So a symbol put here is visible to drm_drv.c and to nobody else, which is
 * why the two below are here and O_CLOEXEC is not.
 *
 * <linux/kernel.h> comes first and is not a mainline mount.h include either --
 * it is here for what this file now defines. noop_llseek() returns loff_t and
 * kdev_t.h's helpers take dev_t, and both types live in kernel.h; fs.h carries
 * neither (it defines the file and inode *layouts* and nothing else), so
 * without this include the header depends on its includer having pulled
 * kernel.h already, which is true of mm.h and untrue of drm_drv.c.
 *
 *   <linux/kdev_t.h>  MINORBITS, for DRM_EXTENDED_MINOR_LIMIT (drm_drv.c:141).
 *                     mainline reaches it because fs.h includes kdev_t.h; the
 *                     pinned fs.h defines MKDEV/MAJOR/MINOR with the bit count
 *                     spelled inline and never names the macro.
 *   <linux/sizes.h>   SZ_8, for the bits-to-bytes pitch rounding in
 *                     drm_dumb_buffers.c:180.
 *
 * noop_llseek() comes from further down this file rather than <linux/mm.h>,
 * where it used to be: mm.h includes mount.h (for the VFS block below), so
 * including mm.h back would be a cycle.
