 * (nothing here can sleep), so the whole annotation is nothing.
 *
 * It is defined here, of all places, because of who calls it: xarray.h's
 * static inline bodies do, at :594 and thirteen more sites through :1059.
 * With no definition in scope the build's -Wno-implicit-function-declaration
 * made each call an external reference, which is the undefined `might_alloc`
 * lld-link reported for drm_minor_alloc() (drm_drv.c) and drm_syncobj.c.
 * mainline's home for it, <linux/sched/mm.h>, is a stand-in with nothing in it
 * (xarray.h:21 includes it and gets no more than the include), and the callers
 * are xarray.h bodies, so the definition has to come from a header xarray.h
 * itself already includes: this one, through bitmap.h (:12) -> kernel.h ->
 * here (kernel.h:128), which is before any of those bodies is parsed on every
 * include path.
 *
 * A macro and not a typed inline like mainline's: gfp_t is a kernel.h:55
 * typedef, and this header is parsed from headers that have their own reason
 * to be included before kernel.h; the annotation is worth neither the
 * dependency nor a type the body does not read.

 * nothing to deadlock on. This is also what Linux itself did before 2.6.24,
 * when tty_flip_buffer_push() called the flush directly. The behaviour that
 * changes is latency, not correctness: a byte arrives at n_tty before the
 * interrupt handler returns instead of after.
