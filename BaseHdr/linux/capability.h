 * anything ever reads it back from userspace.

 * include/linux/capability.h, for the reason CAP_SYS_ADMIN's comment gives:
 * it may never be compared with anything, but it is spelled as a decimal
 * literal and an undefined identifier there would be read as 0 -- which here
 * would mean CAP_CHOWN rather than an unknown capability.
 *
 * capable() ignores its argument (top of this file), so the branch resolves to

 * called once, at tty_ioctl.c:843, to gate TIOCSLCKTRMIOS (locking the line
 * settings of a terminal) behind a capability check.
 *
 * mainline keeps the type and the object in <linux/user_namespace.h> and the
 * predicate in <linux/capability.h> here; DCL has no user_namespace.h, and
 * the predicate is the only thing that needs either, so both live beside it.
 * The struct is a placeholder member and nothing more: the object exists so
 * that `&init_user_ns` has an address to take, and it is never dereferenced
 * -- mainline's is roughly sixty fields of uid/gid mapping, all of which
 * answer a question this build has no way to ask.
 *
 * The predicate answers yes for the same reason capable() does: DCL's access
 * gate is the devfs node's permissions, not the capability bitmap.  mainline's
 * body is `ns_capable(ns, CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE) || ns_capable(ns,
 * CAP_SYS_ADMIN)`; there is no ns_capable() here to call and no namespace
 * table to look the caller up in, so the argument is dropped rather than
 * consulted -- which is why the struct can be this empty.
