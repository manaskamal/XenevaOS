/*
 * DCL <linux/file.h> -- the struct file helpers that used to live only in
 * this scaffolding.
 *
 * mkh.sh created the original so clang would stop reporting a missing include
 * and start reporting what was *used* from it, which is exactly what
 * happened: virtio_console.c's port_fops_open() calls nonseekable_open(), and
 * the include that resolves it upstream is <linux/fs.h> -- the one header DCL
 * does not edit. So what this header owes is spelled here, in mainline's own
 * home for it: mainline splits fs/open.c's file helpers out to a header
 * rather than making every caller reach through fs.h, and DCL has one more
 * reason than mainline does to want that split.
 *
 * <linux/cdev.h> includes this file, which is how a character-device driver
 * reaches it: port_fops_open() is a .cdev open, and a driver should not have
 * to name a second header for a helper its first one already owes it.
 * It is safe to include anywhere -- it pulls <linux/fs.h>, <linux/fcntl.h>,
 * <linux/capability.h>, <linux/pid.h> and nothing else, and specifically not
 * <linux/kobject.h>, which is why the bodies live in
 * DCL/linux_cdev_shim.c rather than somewhere that already includes cdev.h.
 * None of the four can reach <linux/sched.h>, which is the property that
 * matters here: see the note at the bottom of fcntl.h.
 */

#include <linux/fs.h>

/*
 * <linux/fcntl.h> for the O_* flags, and it is the same situation as
 * nonseekable_open() below: mainline's <linux/fs.h> includes fcntl.h, and
 * DCL's fs.h is pinned so it includes nothing.
 *
 * This header rather than any other is where they land, because mainline's
 * file.h is where get_unused_fd_flags() is declared and drm_lease.c:532
 * calls it with `get_unused_fd_flags(cl->flags & (O_CLOEXEC | O_NONBLOCK))`
 * -- one line needing the function and its flag vocabulary from the same
 * place. drm_lease.c:494 uses the two flags alone, for the same reason.
 *
 * It is safe here, and not only because fcntl.h has stopped including
 * <linux/types.h> (see the note at the bottom of fcntl.h for why that
 * mattered to <Fs/vfs.h>): this header is included by linux_cdev_shim.c at
 * line 9, before <Fs/vfs.h> at line 11, and the flags are now a leaf -- two
 * headers of #defines between here and nothing.

#include <linux/fcntl.h>

/*
 * <linux/pid.h>, for the same reason fcntl.h above is here: mainline's
 * <linux/fs.h> includes it (fs.h:20), and a drm source reaches it through
 * that chain without naming it.
 *
 * The consumer is drm_file.c:1030's `pid_task(pid, PIDTYPE_TGID)`, which
 * needs the enum constant and the function. None of the nine headers
 * drm_file.c does name pulls pid.h in -- module.h, file.h, pci.h, slab.h and
 * anon_inodes.h are all checked against mainline's own copies.
 *
 * Safe to reach from here for the reason fcntl.h is: pid.h includes nothing
 * at all, so it cannot reach <linux/sched.h> and its `current` macro.
 *
 * capable() is deliberately *not* here, though mainline's fs.h carries
 * capability.h as well. drm_ioctl.c needs capable() and does not include
 * this header, whereas it and both other consumers do include
 * <linux/pci.h>; so capability.h is carried once, there, rather than twice
 * from two different justifications.

 *
 * There is no file-descriptor table in this kernel: no __fdget(), no fget(),

 * answers an empty fd for every input, which is not a stub pretending to

 * :710 `if (fd_empty(f)) return -EINVAL;` is the first thing that function
 * does after the declaration, so an fd-based syncobj import returns -EINVAL
 * and touches nothing behind it.
 *
 * fd_destructor is empty for the same reason fd_constructor returns empty:
 * there is no reference to drop, because there was never one to take. It is
 * spelled by name rather than built with DEFINE_FREE(), because CLASS()'s
 * expansion looks for `name##_destructor` specifically -- see the note on
 * CLASS() in <linux/cleanup.h>.

 * leave empty: every caller (drm_lease.c:532, drm_syncobj.c:669,
 * drm_atomic_uapi.c:1400, drm_prime.c:516) tests `fd < 0` and unwinds before

 * it in <linux/fs.h> (:2527) as a dentry_open() of the source file, and there
 * is no dentry tree here to open through. Its one caller (drm_lease.c:551)
