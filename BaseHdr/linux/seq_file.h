 *
 * The signatures here deliberately match the stubs already sitting in
 * DCL/linux_cdev_shim.c (seq_printf/seq_read/seq_lseek), taking `const void*`
 * rather than mainline's `struct seq_file *`: those stubs are linked into the
 * kernel already, and two declarations of one symbol with different pointer
 * types is the kind of mismatch a C linker will happily accept and a reader
 * will never spot. The header bends to the existing body, not the other way
 * round -- the call sites pass a seq_file*, which converts to void* freely.

 * that "incomplete definition of type 'struct seq_file'". mainline's struct
 * is the whole /proc iterator state -- buf, size, from, count, version,
 * index, op, lock, private -- and none of the rest has a referent here: DCL
 * has no procfs (the header's own note above), seq_printf() takes `const
 * void*` so no member of this type is read from any header, and the only
 * member a ported source names is `private`, which is what single_open()
 * writes the show callback's data into.
 *
 * So the members below are the ones a *reader* of this header could
 * plausibly name, in mainline's spelling for the ones that are kept, and the
 * layout is deliberately not mainline's: nothing in this tree passes a
 * seq_file across a boundary that already has an opinion about its size.

 * Field order and types are mainline's; the one thing worth naming is that
