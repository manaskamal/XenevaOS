/*
 * DCL <linux/sched.h> -- task state, `current`, and schedule().
 *
 * Xeneva has no sleeping scheduler for kernel context: there is nothing to
 * switch away to, so `schedule()` cannot do what mainline's does. Pretending
 * otherwise would be the worst kind of wrongness here -- a driver that
 * believes it slept would loop forever on a condition that never arrives.
 * Instead the honest shape is kept and the sleeps are made *short and
 * bounded*, which is what the tty code actually needs from them:
 *
 *   schedule()
 *       Sleeps a millisecond. tty_open() retries on -EAGAIN with
 *       `schedule(); goto retry_open;` (tty_io.c:2127 and :2153) -- with a
 *       no-op that becomes a hard spin against a condition only an
 *       interrupt can change, so a millisecond of yield is the difference
 *       between a retry loop and a locked-up console.
 *
 *   signal_pending() / fatal_signal_pending()
 *       Always 0. Xeneva has no signals to deliver, so no wait can be broken
 *       out of this way. That is recorded rather than papered over, because
 *       it has one real consequence: uart_wait_modem_status() (serial_core.c:
 *       1200) loops until a modem-status interrupt or a signal, so TIOCMWAIT
 *       on a port that never raises one never returns. Closing that needs a
 *       bounded wait at the serial_core call site -- stage 4's list, not a
 *       lie in this header.
 *
 *   current
 *       One task_struct per kernel context, with `comm` filled from the
 *       running thread. `current` is an object-like macro, exactly as on
 *       mainline, which means a struct member literally named `current`
 *       would not compile against this header. Nothing in the tty/serial
 *       set has one (the only `file->current` in the tree is Xeneva's own
 *       loader and FAT code, which do not include DCL headers).
 *
 *       `signal->tty` is NULL: it is read by tty_io.c:2280 in tiocsti(), the
 *       TIOCSTI gate, and only there. NULL makes TIOCSTI answer -EPERM for a
 *       non-admin, which is the safe direction -- TIOCSTI injects keystrokes
 *       into another terminal and is disabled by default upstream for
 *       exactly that reason.
 *
 * task_lock()/task_unlock() are the one guard tty_io.c takes directly
 * (guard(task_lock)(p) at :3046), so the class lives here with the primitive.
