 * and both land on the generic timer (KernelAA64/Hal/aa64cpu.c:232). That
 * matters more than it looks: 8250_port.c waits 1-20us on THRE/RI transitions
 * inside polling loops (lines 1243, 1988, 2194, 2198), so a millisecond floor
 * under udelay() would turn wait_for_xmitr() into a ~1000x crawl and put the
 * "send a byte" path far past its timeout. A real microsecond sleep is the
 * difference between an 8250 driver that works and one that appears to hang.
 *
 * The three variants below are the rest of mainline's set. None of the nine
 * serial/tty files uses them today; they are here so the next driver that
 * does does not have to add a header to compile.
