 * get_zeroed_page() / free_page() -- the tty xmit buffer's allocator

 *
 * TWO THINGS ABOUT THE SIGNATURE, both because this is aarch64-unknown-windows:
 *
 * 1. The parameter and return are `uintptr_t`, not mainline's `unsigned
 *    long`.  This target is LLP64: unsigned long is 4 bytes, a pointer is 8,
 *    and get_zeroed_page hands back a heap address the TLSF allocator carved
 *    out of `0xFFFFC00000000000`.  Declaring it `unsigned long` would narrow
 *    on the way out, so every page handed to a port would be an address in
 *    the low 4 GB that nothing maps -- and free_page() would then be handed
 *    back a number that could not identify it.  This is the partner half of
 *    a two-part fix: the two `unsigned long` lines in serial_core.c that
 *    carry the address have to be uintptr_t too, and doing only one half of
 *    that pair would achieve nothing.
 *
 * 2. It is one page from the ordinary allocator, not from a page allocator:
 *    Xeneva's pmmngr manages physical pages for the initial identity map and
 *    has no per-page free list for the kernel heap, while kcalloc() already
 *    zeroes and kfree() already understands the block.  The page needs to be
 *    zeroed because kfifo_init() is handed it as a fresh ring and reads
 *    nothing that was not written.  PAGE_SIZE comes from <Mm/vmmngr.h>,
 *    included at the top of this header.

 *
 * The window is fixed at DCL_KASPRINTF_MAX rather than mainline's
 * measure-then-allocate pair.  There is no measuring call to hand the format
 * to twice: _vsnprintf() would report a length, but the sizing pass upstream
 * does needs vsnprintf(NULL, 0, ...) to be legal, and DCL's formatter lives
 * in Xeneva's _print.c with no NULL-buffer contract to rely on -- guessing

 * buffer is allocated first at a size no caller can exceed and the copy is
 * bounded, which fails as a truncated name instead of as a write past the
 * end.
