 * same bytes in the same order but spells them the way a C struct that
 * nobody can write `.driver.name` against would. That mattered as soon as a

 * 'driver' does not refer to any field in type 'struct virtio_driver'"),
 * which is what the first vendored build reported.
 *
 * Layout is unchanged, and that is the part to keep intact: `name` stays at
 * offset 0 and `_rest` is the 144 bytes that used to be `_device_driver_tail`,
 * so struct device_driver is 152 bytes exactly as the old prefix was, the
 * offset of id_table and every member after it is untouched, and the ABI the
 * prebuilt modules were assembled against still holds. Nothing outside reads
 * this flat today (register_virtio_driver() only ever touches ->probe,
 * ->scan and ->id_table), so this is a widening of what can be written, not
 * a move of anything that existed.
 *
 * mainline's continues with bus, owner, mod_name, probe, of_match_table and
 * the rest of the bind machinery. Those are not here: DCL has no bus type to
 * point at and no sysfs to bind through, and a member that is always NULL
 * plus a member nothing reads is two more offsets for a future port to have
 * to keep straight. If a driver needs one of them, adding it means deciding
