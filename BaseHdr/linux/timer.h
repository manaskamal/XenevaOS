 *
 * The three arguments look like a plain container_of() with an extra one,
 * and the difference matters: container_of()'s first argument is the pointer
 * *to the member*, whereas here it is the pointer *to the container* -- and
 * the container is the variable being declared. So `vblank` in

 *
 * is read before it exists, but only for its type. That is why the expansion
 * takes __typeof__(*ptr) rather than deriving the type from the member, and
 * why the second argument is what gets passed through to container_of():
 * there the static_assert checks that the pointer points at a `field`, and
 * `t` does.
 *
 * __typeof__ rather than typeof because this target is not in GNU mode by
 * default.

 * Jiffies -- derived from the ARM generic timer, not counted by a tick.

 * Nothing in Xeneva increments a tick counter: there is no timer IRQ calling
 * a scheduler tick, so an `extern volatile unsigned long jiffies` would link
 * to a variable that never moves, and every `time_after(jiffies, timeout)` a
 * driver writes would then be false forever -- a polling loop that never
 * notices its deadline, which reads as a hang rather than a timeout. Reading
 * the same counter that udelay() burns against keeps comparisons honest with
 * no tick to service, at HZ (250) resolution.
 *
 * It is an object-like macro, so `jiffies++` and `&jiffies` do not compile.
 * Nothing in the tree does either -- the uses are reads (8250_port.c,
 * n_tty.c, serial_core.c) -- and a compile error is the right answer if that
 * changes, rather than a silently wrong increment.
