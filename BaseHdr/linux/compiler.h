 * Address-space / provenance annotations mainline hangs on declarations.
 *
 * They are empty here, and that is the entire job: on a mainline build they
 * carry a pointer's provenance (user, kernel, MMIO, sparse's bitwise) through
 * a checker DCL does not run -- there is no sparse in this toolchain, only
 * -Wall -Wextra over a freestanding aarch64 target.
 *
 * What is not optional is that the *names* exist.  `typedef u64 __bitwise
 * upf_t;` with no __bitwise defined turns the annotation into an ordinary
 * identifier, and clang parses it as the typedef's NAME: __bitwise comes out
 * as the declared type, upf_t is left stray, and the next line's
 * `typedef unsigned int __bitwise upstat_t;` becomes a redefinition of
 * __bitwise.  The diagnostic then names upstat_t and points at the second
 * line, so the fault reads as "upstat_t conflicts with upf_t" when the real
 * problem is a missing macro six tokens earlier.  That is a very cheap way to
 * lose an hour, hence the note rather than a bare #define.
 *
 * Only the annotations the tty/serial headers actually reference are defined,
 * not mainline's full set -- <linux/cleanup.h> records the same preference.
