 * DCL <linux/irq.h> -- the two helpers the serial code reads the interrupt

 * lines of controller plumbing DCL does not have and does not call), so this
 * one carries only the read side plus the registration API by including
 * <linux/interrupt.h>.
 *
 * irq_get_irq_data() returns NULL: no wakeup source is ever armed here, and
 * irqd_is_wakeup_set() is therefore truthfully 0. That is not a stub hiding a
 * feature -- serial_core.c:2385 and 8250_port.c:1828 both test the result
 * before acting, and "nothing is a wake source" is the exact answer.
 *
 * struct irq_data stays incomplete on purpose: those two sites only ever pass
 * the pointer back to irqd_is_wakeup_set(), and an opaque type keeps anyone
 * from reaching into a structure DCL does not maintain.
