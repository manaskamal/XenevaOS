/*
 * DCL <linux/hw_random.h> -- struct hwrng and the register/unregister pair.
 *
 * Field order is copied from mainline v7.2 include/linux/hw_random.h and must
 * stay that way: DCL/linux_kmod_shim.c hands the registered rng back out as an
 * opaque pointer and reads ->name / ->read off it, so the two definitions are
 * one ABI in two files. If a field moves here, the shim reads the wrong one
 * and every hwrng read returns garbage -- quietly, because the types are all
 * still pointers.
 *
 * The prototypes match mainline exactly, in particular
 *
 *     int (*read)(struct hwrng *rng, void *data, size_t max, bool wait);
 *
 * `size_t`, not `unsigned long`: this target is aarch64 *Windows*, LLP64, so
 * unsigned long is 4 bytes while size_t is 8. A shim copy declaring `unsigned
 * long max` still lines up as a struct (every member above it is a pointer)
 * but passes a 32-bit argument where the callee reads 64, which only works
 * while the compiler happens to zero-extend. That mismatch was found while
 * bringing virtio-rng in through the vendored build; the shim copy now
 * follows this header rather than the other way round.
 *
 * ### The private tail is deliberately absent
 *
 * mainline continues with `struct list_head list; struct kref ref; struct
 * work_struct cleanup_work; struct completion cleanup_done; struct completion
 * dying;` -- all of it bookkeeping for hwrng core's unregister-delay machinery.
 * DCL's hwrng_register() (linux_kmod_shim.c) is a fixed-size table of
 * pointers: it stores the address and never touches the tail, so the fields
 * would be allocation nobody reads. Keeping them would also mean including
 * <linux/list.h> here to give `list` a complete type, which puts mainline's
 * `list_add(list_head*, list_head*)` into every translation unit that reaches
 * this header -- and Xeneva's own <list.h> spells `list_add(list_t*, void*)`,
 * so any TU that ever sees both fails to compile (that is the stage-1 gotcha,
 * recorded in the tracker). One unused member is not worth that.
 *
 * If DCL ever ports the real hwrng core, add the tail back and accept the
 * list.h inclusion -- but then, and only then.
