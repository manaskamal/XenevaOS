/*
 * DCL <linux/uaccess.h> -- the user-access family mainline drivers copy in.
 *
 * XenevaOS keeps the calling process's page tables active while it runs a
 * syscall: the devfs bridge hands raw user pointers straight to
 * ->read/->write, and this kernel already dereferences them there. So the
 * copy_*_user family is a direct copy wearing mainline's contract:
 *
 *   copy_to_user/copy_from_user/clear_user  return bytes NOT copied, 0 == ok
 *   access_ok                               returns 1 (no separate range)
 *
 * That keeps a mainline .c honest -- its `if (copy_to_user(...)) return
 * -EFAULT;` branches behave exactly as upstream -- while the memory model
 * stays Xeneva's. A VMA probe can be added behind access_ok later without
 * touching a single caller.
 *
 * Mainline declares these in include/linux/uaccess.h.
