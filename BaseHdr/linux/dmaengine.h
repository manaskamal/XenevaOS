/*
 * DCL <linux/dmaengine.h> -- the four names struct uart_8250_dma spells out,
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * mainline's copy is 56 KB: the dma_device/dma_chan objects, the channel
 * request/release and slave-capability machinery, cyclic descriptors,
 * interleaved transfers, the whole engine. Xeneva has no DMA layer, and 8250
 * on every board in scope (iMX8MP, RPi3b+, QEMU's pl011/16550) runs PIO.
 * What the driver does need is for the *struct* to parse, because
 * 8250.h:20-44 embeds two dma_filter_fn, two dma_slave_config and two
 * dma_cookie_t as fields of uart_8250_dma -- fields whose values only matter
 * if CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_DMA code is compiled in, which it is not.
 *
 * So the four declarations below are copied from mainline rather than
 * reduced, for the reason <linux/serial_core.h>'s header comment gives: a
 * struct that disagrees with its vendor source by one field compiles cleanly
 * and then reads the wrong offset, and a type whose layout is invented here
 * is the same trap in a smaller box. The rest of the engine is absent because
 * nothing calls it -- see the same rule at the top of <linux/cleanup.h>.
 *
 *   upstream  include/linux/dmaengine.h  (mainline v7.2)
 *   extracted: enum dma_transfer_direction, enum dma_slave_buswidth,
 *              dma_cookie_t, dma_filter_fn, struct dma_slave_config
