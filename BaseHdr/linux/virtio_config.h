/*
 * DCL <linux/virtio_config.h> -- a router, and four helpers mainline puts
 * here that <linux/virtio.h> does not.
 *
 * ### Why this is not mainline's 699-line header
 *
 * mainline's <linux/virtio_config.h> carries its own copies of the three
 * types DCL's <linux/virtio.h> already defines: `struct virtqueue_info`
 * (:29), `struct virtio_config_ops` (:112) and, through the helpers, an
 * opinion about `struct virtio_device` -- it reads `vdev->features_array`
 * (:228, :239, :250) and declares `virtio_find_vqs()` with an
 * `struct irq_affinity *` parameter (:293) that disagrees with the one in
 * virtio.h. Two definitions of one struct in one translation unit is a hard
 * redefinition error, and DCL's version is the one that is authoritative:
 * it is the layout the native AuVirtIO layer fills in and the layout the
 * module loader indexes, and `features_array` is not a member of it and
 * cannot be added without deciding where in `_linux_prefix[0x328]` the
 * feature bitmap mainline keeps there is supposed to live.
 *
 * So the header includes <linux/virtio.h> and stops. Everything mainline
 * defines below the type declarations that DCL does not need is not needed
 * here either: virtio_cread8/16/32/64, virtio_get_status/set_status,
 * virtio_device_ready, virtio_find_vqs, the endian wrappers -- all of those
 * are already in virtio.h, which is the file this one routes to.
 *
 * ### The four helpers that are actually missing
 *
 * __virtio_test_bit / virtio_has_feature / virtio_cread_feature are what a
 * mainline driver tests a feature bit with; virtio_device_for_each_vq is the
 * list walk. They cannot come from virtio.h because mainline does not put
 * them there, and a ported source is written against mainline's *layout of
 * the headers*, not against where DCL happens to prefer things.

/*
 * __virtio_test_bit(vdev, fbit) -- is feature `fbit` agreed with this device?
 *
 * mainline reads `vdev->features_array[fbit]`: a bitmap of the features that
 * survived negotiation, filled once by virtio_finalise_features(). DCL has no
 * negotiation to have survived -- see shim_finalize_features() in
 * DCL/virtio_shim.c, which writes the device's whole feature set back
 * unfiltered and sets FEATURES_OK (it reports failure only if the device
 * itself rejects). The guest accepts everything the device offers, so
 * "offered" and "agreed" name the same bits, and the bitmap mainline caches
 * is here a query instead:
 *
 *     vdev->config->get_features(vdev)
 *
 * which is shim_get_features() -- two reads of the device's DevFeature
 * registers, select 0 then select 1, reassembled lo||hi. Two MMIO-ish reads
 * per feature test, where mainline does one load from memory, on paths that
 * run a handful of times at probe and once per config change: not worth a
 * cache, and a cache would have to be invalidated by something that does not
 * exist yet.
 *
 * The NULL guard is not defensive padding. use_multiport() calls this at
 * virtio_console.c:343 during probe, and probe runs for a device whose config
 * ops were installed by virtio_device_register() -- but a ported source that
 * builds its own virtio_device would not have gone through that path, and a
 * NULL call there faults with no register to point at. FALSE is the answer
 * that keeps the caller on the single-port path, which is the safe one.

 * both were added for this macro, because the only caller -- remove_vqs(),
 * virtio_console.c:1895 -- is the loop that flushes and frees every in-flight
 * receive buffer, and a macro that quietly walked nothing would leave that
 * loop silently empty rather than obviously wrong.
 *
 * The head is initialised by virtio_device_register() and the queues are
 * linked in by shim_find_vqs(); _virtio_devices[]'s snapshot copy gets its
 * own empty head so that walking *it* terminates instead of treating the
 * original's head as if it were a struct virtqueue.
