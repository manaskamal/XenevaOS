/*
 * DCL <linux/llist.h> -- the lockless singly-linked list tty_buffer.c keeps
 * its *free* buffers on.
 *
 * It exists for one specific shape of traffic: a tiny buffer (<= 256 bytes)
 * is recycled far more often than it is created, and the free list is touched
 * both from flush_to_ldisc() and from the driver's allocation path. A singly
 * linked list with an atomic head swap needs no per-node back pointers and no
 * lock, which is what those two callers want.
 *
 * Deliberately a subset of mainline: llist_add_batch() and the _cc variants
 * are omitted because nothing in the staged tty/serial set calls them. Adding
 * them when something does beats carrying a surface nobody has compiled.
 *
 * The subtle part is llist_for_each_entry_safe(): it must not run its body
 * when handed a NULL node (an empty list), and `container_of(NULL, type, m)`
 * is a *computed address*, not NULL -- so the guard is the address of the
 * member itself, which folds back to exactly 0:
 *
 *     pos = container_of(NULL, struct tty_buffer, free);   // pos != NULL
 *     &pos->member  ==  NULL                               // but this is 0
 *
 * That is mainline's own trick (member_address_is_nonnull), and the arithmetic
 * is done in integers so it never forms a non-canonical pointer the CPU could
 * touch -- the body is guarded before anything is dereferenced.
 *
 * The integer is uintptr_t, not mainline's `unsigned long`. This target is
 * aarch64 *Windows*, which is LLP64: unsigned long is 32 bits, so casting a
 * pointer through it truncates. That is not a theoretical concern here -- it
 * is what produced "cast to smaller integer type 'unsigned long' from
 * 'struct llist_node *'" on tty_buffer.c:142, and a buffer whose address ends
 * in 0x????????0000 would have read as 0 after truncation, silently ending
 * the free-list walk one buffer early. uintptr_t is the type that is wide
 * enough by definition, and it silences the warning as a side effect.
