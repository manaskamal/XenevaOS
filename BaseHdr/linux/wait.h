/*
 * DCL <linux/wait.h> -- wait queues, with an honest answer to the one thing
 * this port cannot do: sleep.
 *
 * There is no native equivalent in Xeneva and no scheduler to block in, so
 * the queue is built for real -- the lists, the entries, the wake functions
 * and the bookkeeping are all genuine -- while the *waiting* is done by
 * polling, bounded. The distinction matters: what must not happen is a driver
 * that believes it slept and then loops on a condition that only ever changes
 * while it is spinning.
 *
 * Three call sites decide the design (the measured blocking surface of the
 * nine files: 7 wait-queue ops, 5 schedule()):
 *
 *   n_tty.c:2232 / :2354 -- blocking read and write, via
 *       DEFINE_WAIT_FUNC(wait, woken_wake_function) + add_wait_queue + a loop
 *       that ends in wait_woken(). Both are stage 5's EAGAIN-first cut; until
 *       that lands, an O_NONBLOCK fd returns -EAGAIN before reaching here
 *       (n_tty checks tty_io_nonblock() first), and a blocking fd with no
 *       data spins in wait_woken() rather than sleeping. The queue itself
 *       must therefore be correct -- it is what the cut will hang off.
 *
 *   serial_core.c:3194 -- wait_event(state->remove_wait,
 *       !atomic_read(&state->refcount)) during port removal. The condition is
 *       normally already true (refcount drops to zero on the line above), so
 *       the bounded poll sees it on the first test and returns.
 *
 *   serial_core.c:1205 / tty_io.c:3118 -- DECLARE_WAITQUEUE and
 *       init_waitqueue_head at construction, no waiting at all.
 *
 * wait_event() polls for DCL_WAIT_EVENT_MS and, if the condition still has
 * not come true, says so through dcl_wait_event_timeout() before falling
 * through. Mainline would block indefinitely there; falling through is the
 * wrong answer dressed as the right one, which is exactly why it is logged
 * instead of being quiet -- an unconditional block is a hung kernel and an
 * unconditional fall-through is a corrupt one, and neither should look like
 * a normal boot.
 *
 * add_wait_queue/remove_wait_queue are real list operations with no lock
 * held across them (DCL's spinlocks are no-ops -- see <linux/spinlock.h>),
 * so a wake arriving concurrently with an add is not excluded. That matches
 * the locking contract of everything else here.

 * budget expired first. A 0 on the second arm would walk past the wait with
