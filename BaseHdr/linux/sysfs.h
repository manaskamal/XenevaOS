 * DCL <linux/sysfs.h> -- the two attribute structs and the __ATTR family.
 *
 * mainline splits this across sysfs.h and device.h; DCL has no kobject layer,
 * so what is here is only what a ported driver *declares*: a static
 * device_attribute produced by DEVICE_ATTR_RW() and a static attribute_group
 * to hang it in (8250_port.c:3089-3097). Nothing creates a sysfs file from
 * them yet -- registration goes through uart_port.attr_group, whose consumer
 * is the stage that brings uart_add_one_port over.
 *
 * struct attribute is mainline's two members verbatim (the lockdep fields are
 * behind CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC, which DCL does not set). struct
 * attribute_group is deliberately shorter: see the comment inside it.

 * constant would be a poor trade, so the bound is spelled out and the reason
 * is here: 4096 is DCL's page size on every target in scope (Mm/vmmngr.h:90),

/*
 * sysfs_create_group() / sysfs_remove_group() -- macros, not functions, and
 * the reason is worth the whole block.
 *
 * DCL/linux_cdev_shim.c used to define these as ordinary functions taking
 * `const void*`. That works until a mainline caller writes
 *
 *     err = sysfs_create_group(&port->dev->kobj, &port_attribute_group);
 *                                                    (virtio_console.c:1642)
 *
 * because the *argument* still has to parse, and `port->dev->kobj` is a member
 * that does not exist: <linux/fs.h>'s struct device (the one file this tree
 * must not edit) carries `kobj_name` at offset 0 -- the slot mainline's
 * kobj.name occupies -- and no `kobj`. Making struct device grow one is not
 * available, and rewriting the vendored source is what this tree avoids.
 *
 * A macro whose parameters never appear in its replacement list never parses
 * them. The preprocessor substitutes the whole invocation with `0` and
 * `&port->dev->kobj` never reaches the parser at all -- which is exactly how
 * this header's spinlock sibling already handles a lock it does not take
 * (`#define spin_lock(l) do {} while (0)`, spinlock.h:36).
 *
 * The behaviour is unchanged, because the function being replaced was itself
 * a no-op: "no sysfs tree; success keeps add_port() on the happy path". A
 * caller that branches on the result still sees 0 (success), and
 * sysfs_remove_group() still does nothing -- there is no group to remove.
