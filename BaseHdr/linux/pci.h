/*
 * DCL pci.h -- the PCI surface the drm set names, and now a bus behind it.
 *
 * This header was compile-only for its first act: there was no PCI on the
 * boards this kernel targets, drm_file.c:987 and drm_ioctl.c:152 asked
 * dev_is_pci(dev->dev) before every bus-id setup, the answer was always
 * false, and the struct below was a three-member sketch sized for the BDF
 * string those reads print. The scanout stage changed what it has to carry:
 * QEMU's bochs-display is a real PCI device, and the vendored driver that
 * owns it (Vendored/drivers/gpu/drm/tiny/bochs.c) compiles and links whole
 * against this surface -- probe/remove/shutdown records, the id_table match
 * quadruple, BAR resources with start/length/flags, and the
 * pci_set/get_drvdata pair.
 *
 * The bus behind the surface is DCL/pci_shim.c: it walks the ECAM window the
 * native pcie code already maps, fills one struct pci_dev per function, and
 * runs id_table matching plus probe when a vendored driver registers. This
 * header stays a pure data contract except for one participant:
 * dev_is_pci() now has to answer for real devices (drm_file.c prints the BDF
 * string when it is true), and the only honest registry of "which devices
 * this bus made" lives in the fabric, so the inline forwards there. That
 * query is also what keeps the vendored drm core's own PCI paths (drm_edid's
 * switcheroo wrappers) answering correctly for a device that is now actually
 * behind a PCI bus, and keeps answering false for every device that is not.
 *
 * struct device lives in the pinned <linux/fs.h> (fs.h:184), which is why
 * this header includes fs.h rather than declaring the member opaque: an
 * incomplete struct device cannot be a member. The pinned struct is 800
 * bytes whether it describes a PCI device or not -- the fabric embeds it
 * inside its own pci_dev and never grows it, per the note in device.h about
 * writes at offset 800 being a heap overrun.
