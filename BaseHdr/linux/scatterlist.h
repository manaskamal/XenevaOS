/*
 * DCL <linux/scatterlist.h> -- struct scatterlist and sg_init_one().
 *
 * ### Deliberately not mainline's layout
 *
 * mainline's struct scatterlist is
 *
 *     unsigned long page_link;   // page pointer + chain/terminate bits
 *     unsigned int  offset;
 *     unsigned int  length;
 *     dma_addr_t    dma_address;
 *
 * -- a *page-based* list, whose whole job is to walk a compound page in
 * physical segments and to carry a DMA address that the IOMMU/streaming
 * mapper filled in. Xeneva has neither: a buffer handed to a virtio queue is
 * a single linear-map virtual address (AuVirtioPCISetupQueue and buf_phys()
 * in virtio_shim.c turn it into a ring address directly), and there is no
 * DMA API to populate dma_address through. So the struct here carries exactly
 * what the one consumer reads:
 *
 *     struct scatterlist { void* buf; unsigned int len; };
 *
 * That is the shape DCL/linux_kmod_shim.c's sg_init_one() fills in, and the
 * shape virtio_shim.c's virtqueue_add_inbuf/sgs walk -- both of which are
 * written against this definition, not against upstream's. Keeping upstream's
 * fields here would leave four members that every write has to remember to
 * leave zero, for a mapping layer that does not exist.
 *
 * The consequence worth writing down: a driver that reaches into the sg for a
 * page (`sg_virt()` on a compound page, DMA mapping helpers) will not build.
 * Add those when something needs them, with the linear-map address doing the
 * job of `page_link`.
 *
 * This struct used to live in <linux/virtio.h>, which included it in every
 * file that talked to a virtqueue. It is here because that is mainline's home
 * for it, so a ported source includes the header mainline tells it to; virtio.h
 * now includes this file instead of redeclaring the type. Exactly one
 * definition either way -- two would be two different `struct scatterlist`s
 * with no way to pass one to the other.
 */

#include <linux/kernel.h>	/* size_t */

/*
 * One contiguous region, as the shim sees it. buf is a *virtual* address in
 * the linear map; the shim converts to a bus address at kick time.
 *
 * `page` is the one member that is not read by the queue machinery -- it is
 * the bookkeeping a *releasing* driver walks. virtio_console.c:350-357 does
 *
 *     for (i = 0; i < buf->sgpages; i++) {
 *         struct page *page = sg_page(&buf->sg[i]);
 *         if (!page)
 *             break;
 *         put_page(page);
 *     }
 *
 * and sg_set_page() at :872/:891 is what would have put the pointer there.
 * Without a slot for it sg_page() has nothing to return but NULL, the `break`
 * fires on the first entry, and the pages behind it are never released: a
 * leak that no test in this tree would report, because the only path that
 * fills sgpages > 0 is the splice one (see <linux/splice.h> on why that is
 * not reachable here). Carrying the pointer costs 8 bytes an entry and makes
 * the release loop do what it reads as doing.
 *
 * buf stays the first member: every existing walk (virtio_shim.c,
 * linux_kmod_shim.c's sg_init_one) reads ->buf and ->len by name, and putting
 * a pointer in front of them would move those offsets for no gain.

 * struct sg_table -- the *list* of scatterlists, and the reason this header

 * drm_cache.h:41 declares `void drm_clflush_sg(struct sg_table *st);` and
 * drm_cache.c:127 defines the same function. Both spell the parameter
 * identically, and clang still reports "conflicting types for
 * 'drm_clflush_sg'" -- because nothing named `struct sg_table` at file scope
 * before those lines. C scopes a struct tag that is *first* mentioned inside a
 * function prototype's parameter list to that declaration alone, so the two
 * lines name two unrelated incomplete types and the signatures genuinely do
 * differ. clang warns about the rule first ("declaration of 'struct sg_table'
 * will not be visible outside of this function", -Wvisibility) and errors
 * after, and reading only the error sends you hunting for a difference
 * between two spellings that are byte-identical.
 *
 * mainline does not hit this because mainline's <linux/scatterlist.h>
 * *defines* struct sg_table, so the tag is at file scope before any drm
 * header is parsed. A forward declaration already exists here in drm_drv.h:67,
 * but drm_cache.h does not include it -- and moving the decl there would fix
 * only this consumer, leaving the next header that names the type to
 * rediscover the same rule.
 *
 * All three of mainline's fields, whole, though nothing in this tree fills one
 * yet: `sgl` is the array, `nents` the entries that were mapped, and
 * `orig_nents` the entries that were handed in. A two-field version would be
 * worse than carrying all three -- see the note on struct vm_area_struct in
