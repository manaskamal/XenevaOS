/*
 * DCL <linux/cleanup.h> -- scope guards, in mainline's call syntax.
 *
 * Modern mainline tty/serial code does not say mutex_lock() ... mutex_unlock()
 * a hundred lines apart. It says:
 *
 *     guard(mutex)(&port->mutex) { ... }
 *     scoped_guard(spinlock_irq, &tty->ctrl.lock) { ... }
 *     scoped_cond_guard(mutex_intr, return -ERESTARTSYS, &port->mutex) { ... }
 *
 * There are 120 such sites across serial_core.c, 8250_port.c, n_tty.c and
 * tty_io.c, which makes this header load-bearing rather than ornamental:
 * without it, none of them parse.
 *
 * Mainline builds them on __cleanup()/DEFINE_FREE()/IS_ERR() and a
 * lock_ptr/lock_err protocol spread across <linux/compiler.h>, <linux/err.h>
 * and <linux/args.h>. DCL keeps the *call syntax* -- which is what driver text
 * depends on -- and implements it directly on the one piece of machinery both
 * sides genuinely need, clang's __attribute__((cleanup)).
 *
 * The macros are deliberately spelled DCL_LOCK_GUARD*, not mainline's
 * DEFINE_GUARD_*: adopting mainline's names while changing their argument
 * lists would be a trap for whoever next ports serial_core.h. When that
 * happens the few guard definitions in it get rewritten to these, and the
 * call sites -- the part that matters -- stay byte-identical to upstream.
 *
 * The three forms:
 *
 *   guard(name)(args) { ... }
 *       Acquire on the way in, release when the enclosing scope ends -- on
 *       fall-through, on `break`, on `return`, on `goto`, whichever comes
 *       first. That last part is the entire point: a `return` in the middle
 *       of a critical section still unlocks, which is exactly what a manual
 *       lock()/unlock() pair gets wrong once a function grows an error path.
 *
 *   scoped_guard(name, args) { ... }
 *       The same, with the lifetime bound to the next compound statement.
 *
 *   scoped_cond_guard(name, fail, args) { ... }
 *       For locks that can fail to be acquired. If acquisition failed the
 *       guard holds lock == NULL, so the body is skipped and `fail` runs
 *       instead -- and because nothing was ever locked, the destructor has
 *       nothing to release. `fail` is normally `return -ERESTARTSYS`.
 *
 * Guard *classes* (mutex, spinlock_irq, rwsem_read, uart_port_lock_irq, ...)
 * live beside the primitives they wrap -- <linux/spinlock.h>, <linux/mutex.h>,
 * <linux/rwsem.h>, later serial_core.h -- because a guard is only meaningful
 * next to the lock it takes.
 *
 * DEFINE_FREE()/__free() were added once drm_bridge.h needed them: mainline
 * spells the refcount drop of a chain-walked bridge as an automatic
 * variable's destructor rather than an unmatched put at each return. Unlike
 * the guard macros above, this one has no DCL-specific shape -- it is
 * mainline's body verbatim -- so it lives here rather than beside a lock.
 *
 * DEFINE_CLASS()/ACQUIRE() are still not carried. The nine tty/serial files
 * use none of them (only PCI_DEVICE_CLASS, an unrelated PCI macro, resembles
 * them), so they are still not carried speculatively.
 */

/* clang scope-exit attribute; mainline spells this __cleanup too.
 * Guarded because compiler_attributes.h:76 already defines it, and an
 * unguarded second definition here produced a -Wmacro-redefined warning in
 * every translation unit that reaches both -- which, now that <linux/file.h>
 * includes this header, is most of them. The two definitions agree, so the
 * guard costs nothing and keeps the noise count where it was. */

/*
 * CLASS(name, var) -- the scoped-object declaration. Added after the other
 * three because drm_syncobj.c:710 spells `CLASS(fd, f)(fd);`, and with
 * nothing defined the line has neither a type nor an initialiser, so clang
 * reports "use of undeclared identifier 'f'" at every later read of `f` --
 * :710, :713 and :717, three sites for one missing macro.
 *
 * Note where the expansion stops. CLASS(fd, f) ends at the bare function
 * designator `fd_constructor`, and the `(fd)` written at the *call site* is
 * what supplies the argument. The macro cannot absorb it: the declaration
 * and the call are written as two adjacent tokens by design, and that is
 * also what lets the semicolon at :710 terminate an initialiser instead of
 * leaving a declared-but-uninitialised variable.
 *
 * Only the fd class exists so far, and it lives in <linux/file.h> beside the

/*
 * DEFINE_FREE(name, type, free) / __free(name) -- the cleanup.h pair that

 *
 *     DEFINE_FREE(drm_bridge_put, struct drm_bridge *,
 *                 if (_T) drm_bridge_put(_T))
 *
 * declares __free_drm_bridge_put(void *p), and a declaration written
 *
 *     struct drm_bridge *b __free(drm_bridge_put) = ...;
 *
 * runs that destructor when b goes out of scope.  The destructor body is
 * caller-written text that mentions a local `_T`, which the macro declares
 * as the dereferenced pointee -- hence `_type _T = *(_type *)p` rather than
 * a cast: for `_type = struct drm_bridge *` it evaluates to a
 * `struct drm_bridge *` holding the pointer that was passed in, which is
 * what makes `if (_T) drm_bridge_put(_T)` read correctly.
 *
 * The `if (_T)` is the caller's to write, not the macro's: mainline dropped
 * the IS_ERR_OR_NULL() test that used to live here and moved the null check
 * into each _free expression.  Ported verbatim so a v7.2 caller that omits
 * the test gets mainline's behaviour, including its null deref.
 *
 * __free() is the spelling the attribute is written with and is simply
 * __cleanup() with the name spliced; __cleanup() above is already clang's
 * scope-exit attribute, so nothing here needs new compiler support.

 * Mainline's spelling of the two forms that are actually instantiated.
 *
 * These exist because of Vendored/drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250.h, which says
 *   DEFINE_GUARD(serial8250_rpm, struct uart_8250_port *,
 *                serial8250_rpm_get(_T), serial8250_rpm_put(_T));
 * and vendored files are never rewritten to suit DCL (Vendored/README.md
 * rule 1) -- so when mainline text says DEFINE_GUARD, BaseHdr has to answer
 * to that name. The DCL_* spellings stay for everything written by hand.
 *
 * The header above worried that adopting mainline's names "while changing
 * their argument lists would be a trap". These do NOT change the list:
 * DEFINE_GUARD(_name, _type, _lock, _unlock) has mainline's order, and the
 * one real difference from DCL_LOCK_GUARD is that mainline passes a *pointer*
 * type (`struct uart_port *`) and names the local `_T`, where DCL passes the
 * pointee (`struct mutex`) and makes the local `type *_T`. Two shapes, each
 * self-consistent, so neither spelling quietly means the other's.
 *
 * Not ported here, same rule as above: DEFINE_GUARD_COND and
 * DEFINE_LOCK_GUARD_1_COND. serial_core.h's two _try definitions were
 * removed with it -- nothing in 8250_port.c, serial_core.c or 8250.h takes a
 * _try guard, and a conditional acquire with no caller is machinery nobody
 * can test. The 3-argument forms are what to port if one shows up.
