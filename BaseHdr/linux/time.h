/*
 * DCL <linux/time.h> -- the POSIX clock IDs.
 *
 * mainline keeps these in uapi/linux/time.h and reaches them through
 * linux/time.h; DCL's tree is flat with no uapi/ layer, so this header is the
 * uapi block and nothing else.  Copied verbatim (upstream path and tag below)
 * because every value is an ABI constant: CLOCK_MONOTONIC is 1 because that
 * is what userspace passes to clock_gettime(), and hrtimer_setup() records it
 * in the timer's mode word.
 *
 *   upstream  include/uapi/linux/time.h  (mainline v7.2)
 *
 * Not here yet: struct timespec/timeval/itimerspec, which uapi/linux/time.h
 * also defines.  Nothing in stages 3-7 names them, so they are left to the
 * first caller rather than transcribed on spec -- see the rule at the top of
 * linux/cleanup.h about not carrying a speculative surface.
