 * bitmap_fill / bitmap_empty / bitmap_clear -- the three the xarray port
 * needs, added together because xarray.c:95-113 uses all three to maintain
 * one mark word and a partial answer would be worse than none.
 *
 * The tail handling is not decoration. BITS_PER_LONG is 32 in this build --
 * this target is LLP64, so `long` is four bytes -- and a request is not a
 * multiple of it: node_any_mark() asks about XA_CHUNK_SIZE bits, which is a
 * whole number of words, but bitmap_clear() is asked for a *range* starting
 * at an arbitrary bit (xarray.c:136 passes xa_offset + 1), so both edges can
 * land mid-word. Masking the last word in bitmap_empty() is what stops a
 * set bit past the end of the requested range from making a node look
 * marked, and it is the difference between the mark logic working and it
 * quietly drifting.
 *
 * mainline's bodies live in lib/bitmap.c and reach the same three answers
 * through native_fill()/find_next_bit(); these are the same semantics in a
 * form that needs no second file, since the only consumer is xarray.c.

 * (`bitmap_set(hdmi->y420_cmdb_modes, vic, 1)` at :6089 and the same for
 * y420_vdb_modes at :6124). It is called with len 1 at both sites, but the
 * range form is written out anyway: it is the same loop as bitmap_clear,
 * so a second, single-bit implementation would be the one that could drift
 * from the clear side when the maps are next walked in bulk.
 *
 * The `take == BITS_PER_LONG` branch is bitmap_clear's, for the same
 * reason: `1UL << BITS_PER_LONG` is an undefined shift, and a full-word run
 * is ~0UL with no shift needed. The tail of the range may also land
 * mid-word, which is why the mask is built at `bits` rather than starting
 * at bit 0.
