/*
 * DCL <linux/devres.h> -- managed-device resources without the lifetime.
 *
 * mainline ties every devm_* allocation and action to a struct device's
 * probe-to-remove span and runs them all on device release.  DCL devices
 * have no release: put_device() is a documented no-op (DCL/linux_cdev_shim.c)
 * and no driver in the tree ever unbinds, so the "managed" half reduces to
 * what the call sites actually test.  vkms_drv.c asks devres_open_group()
 * for a non-NULL token before it builds its device and
 * devres_release_group() for a "closed" answer on the way out; drm_drv.c:816
 * returns devm_add_action_or_reset()'s status as the last step of
 * devm_drm_dev_alloc().  Allocations hand back a real allocation -- the
 * caller keeps the pointer on mainline too, and here it is never revoked.
 *
 * This header's include point is <linux/device.h>: mainline spreads these
 * declarations over devres.h and reaches them from device users directly,
 * while DCL's drm chain reaches device.h through drm_print.h, which makes
 * that the one include that covers drm_drv.c, drm_bridge.c and the vkms
 * side (via device/faux.h) without editing a vendored include list.

 * stores it and drm_drv.c drops it, and an "allocation" that leaked or that
 * outlived its free would be a defect rather than a harmless stub. devres_add()
