 * DCL delta -- `uintptr_t`, not mainline's `unsigned long`.
 *
 * This field is not a number: it is the parent pointer with the color bit
 * folded into its bottom two bits, read back by rb_parent() and __rb_color().
 * Its width therefore has to be pointer width.  mainline gets that from
 * `unsigned long` being 64-bit on arm64; this target is
 * aarch64-unknown-windows, which is LLP64 (verified: sizeof(long) == 4), so
 * `unsigned long` keeps the parent address's low 32 bits and every node
 * above the 4 GB mark would walk to a parent in the low 4 GB that nothing
 * maps -- the same narrowing serial_core.c's two address lines have, arriving
 * through a struct field this time.  The writers
 * that fill the field are in rbtree.h and rbtree_augmented.h.
