 * The caller is rx_trig_bytes_store at 8250_port.c:3078:
 *
 *     ret = kstrtou8(buf, 10, &bytes);
 *
 * which parses a number a userspace write() put in the sysfs attribute.  It
 * has to be a real parser, not a stub: this is the one place where a value
 * crosses from userspace into the driver, and a parser that returned a
 * constant would let a write appear to succeed while programming something
 * else.  The three failure returns matter for the same reason -- the caller
 * tests `ret` and answers write() with it, so -EINVAL is what turns a bad
 * write into EIO at the syscall rather than a silent acceptance.
 *
 * Deliberately hand-rolled: DCL has no strtol family anywhere in BaseHdr (the
 * only formatters are _sprintf/_snprintf in <Log/_print.h>), and pulling a
 * whole formatted-input facility in for one two-digit field would be the
 * "speculative surface" <linux/cleanup.h> warns about.  If a later stage
 * needs kstrtoint/kstrtoul, they belong here beside it, not in a second header.

 *   unchanged: 0, -EINVAL for a malformed string, -ERANGE if it does not fit.

/*
 * simple_strtoull() and simple_strtoul() -- and the "simple" in the name is
 * a warning about the contract, not a comment on the code.
 *
 * They differ from kstrtoull()/kstrtoul() in exactly the one way that
 * matters at their two call sites, and it is why mainline's own doc comment
 * on these reads "This function has caveats. Please use kstrtoull instead.":
 * no sign rejection, no end-of-string check, no error return.  They consume
 * digits until one does not fit the radix and hand back whatever accumulated,
 * leaving *endp at the stopping character.  Both callers here pass endp as
 * NULL, so what they want is the value and nothing else.  A kstrtoull() in
 * their place would reject every one of them:
 *
 *   serial_core.c:2136  *addr = simple_strtoull(p, NULL, 0);
 *       uart_parse_earlycon(), whose string is an MMIO address followed by
 *       ",options".  kstrtoull() demands a NUL immediately after the digits
 *       and would refuse the comma, so no earlycon= would ever parse.
 *       The comment mainline leaves above this line says the same thing in
 *       one line: "Before you replace it with kstrtoull(), think about
 *       options separator (',') it will not tolerate."
 *
 *   serial_core.c:2164  *baud = simple_strtoul(s, NULL, 10);
 *       uart_parse_options(), whose format is <baud><parity><bits><flow> --
 *       "115200n8r".  There is no NUL after the digits by design, so the
 *       strict parser would read nothing at all and every console= would
 *       come up with a baud rate of 0.
 *
 * The radix fixup is mainline's _parse_integer_fixup_radix() with the same
 * answers: base 0 means autodetect, where "0x" followed by a hex digit means
 * 16, a leading "0" means 8, otherwise 10 -- and the "0x" prefix is skipped
 * only when base 16 was asked for or arrived at.  Two consequences worth
 * writing down, because they look like bugs and are not: a bare "0" is
 * parsed as octal, so simple_strtoul("09", 0) stops after the '0' and
 * returns 0; and with base 0, "0x" *without* a hex digit after it selects
 * radix 8, which consumes nothing more.  That is what a 32-bit kernel does
 * too, and changing it here would make DCL disagree with the hardware it is
 * parsing command lines for.
 *
 * LLP64 note: simple_strtoul() returns `unsigned long`, four bytes on this
 * target, so it truncates what simple_strtoull() produced.  That is not a
 * defect this port introduced -- it is mainline's behaviour on every 32-bit
 * kernel -- and the saturating path below runs first, so an over-long parse
 * yields 0xFFFFFFFF rather than a value that merely happened to fit in the
 * low word.  The single caller assigns to an int baud rate.
 *
 * mainline's _parse_integer_limit() also ORs a KSTRTOX_OVERFLOW bit into
 * its return, which simple_strntoull() immediately masks back off -- so the
 * bit is not carried through to these two either, and there is nothing here
 * to carry it in.  Saturation to ULLONG_MAX is the whole overflow answer.
