/*
 * DCL delta: mainline declares `struct cdev` here, in its own words.  DCL
 * already carries it in <linux/fs.h> (:141), measured against linux-7.2.6 at
 * kobj 0 / owner 64 / ops 72 / list 80 / dev 96 / count 100 / size 104, and
 * pinned there by static asserts because fs.h's layout is the ABI the rest of
 * the tree is compiled against.  Two definitions of the same struct in one
 * translation unit is a hard redefinition error, and fs.h is the one file that
 * must not move -- so this header yields and routes instead: the struct comes
 * from where it is authoritative, and only the function declarations, which
 * DCL/linux_cdev_shim.c actually implements, are spelled here.
 *
 * __randomize_layout is dropped with it: DCL has no struct-randomization pass,
 * and the layout above is pinned by assertion anyway.
