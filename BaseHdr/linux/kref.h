/*
 * DCL <linux/kref.h> -- reference counting for tty_struct and tty_driver,
 * and now for every drm object that embeds one.
 *
 * Both tty types are handed around as bare pointers by tty_io.c (a cdev open
 * finds a driver, a driver finds a port, a port finds a tty) and freed from
 * whichever path happens to run last. kref is the contract that says "last
 * one out turns the lights off".
 *
 * Xeneva has no real concurrency in these paths -- <linux/mutex.h> records
 * that plainly -- so the counter is atomic for mainline's reasons (the
 * arithmetic must be indivisible on SMP) rather than because anyone here can
 * actually race it. Keeping the operations atomic anyway costs a ldxr/stxr on
 * aarch64 and avoids a header whose semantics differ from mainline's the day
 * the second core turns on.
 *
 * The field is a refcount_t rather than the atomic_t it used to be. That was
 * mainline's own change (commit "kref: add refcount_t"), and this tree could
 * not skip it: drm_connector.c:1070 does not go through a kref helper, it
 * reaches inside the struct and writes
 *
 *     if (!refcount_dec_and_test(&conn->base.refcount.refcount))
 *
 * so the field has to be the type refcount_dec_and_test() takes. An
 * atomic_t there would be the same width and would happen to work, but only
 * by coincidence of layout -- and -Wno-error=incompatible-pointer-types is
 * set for this build, so the mistake would be a warning nobody reads rather
 * than a compile failure. refcount_t also buys saturation, which atomic_t
 * does not have: a kref that underflows wraps to a large positive value and
 * looks like a healthy object that will never be freed.
 *
 * kref_get_unless_zero() is included because tty_port_get() (tty_port.h:164)
 * is written around it: it must decline to take a reference on an object
 * already at zero, or a hangup path resurrects a port being destroyed. It now
 * resolves to refcount_inc_not_zero(), which is mainline's spelling and adds
 * the saturation check the atomic version lacked.
