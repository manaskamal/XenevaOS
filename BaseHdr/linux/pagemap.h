/*
 * DCL <linux/pagemap.h> -- the eight page primitives virtio_console.c uses.
 *
 * mainline's is 50 KB and its first include is <linux/mm.h>, which is the
 * whole memory-management subsystem (rmap, page tables, compaction, the NUMA
 * balancing state reached through gfp.h).  The driver's entire contact with
 * the page model is:
 *
 *     alloc_page(GFP_KERNEL)   :875   splice fallback buffer
 *     page_address(page)       :888   destination of the copy
 *     kmap_local_page / kunmap :887   source window over pipe_buffer.page
 *     get_page / put_page      :868   refcount, and free_buf()'s release loop
 *     lock_page / unlock_page  :869   taken around the steal
 *     sg_page / sg_set_page    :354   <linux/scatterlist.h>, which is DCL's own
 *     PAGE_SIZE / PAGE_MASK    :884   <Mm/vmmngr.h>, Xeneva's native geometry
 *
 * so this header defines exactly that and nothing else.
 *
 * The page *contents* live inside struct page itself.  DCL has no buddy-to-
 * struct-page array and no virtual-address lookup, and splice is not routed
 * by the devfs bridge yet (see <linux/splice.h>), so the honest shape for a
 * page here is one kmalloc'd block that is both the descriptor and the
 * storage.  alloc_page() therefore returns a block whose ->data is what
 * page_address() hands out, which is an ordinary kernel heap pointer -- the
 * same kind of pointer that sg_init_one() already feeds to the virtio queue,
 * so the DMA translation in DCL/virtio_shim.c needs no new case for it.

 * page_address(page) -- the data block of a struct page.
 *
 * It used to be spelled `((page)->data)`, which is right for every call that
 * passes a `struct page *` and wrong the moment anything else does: a member
 * reference through a `void *` argument is a hard error (one `->` on a void
 * base), and virtio_console.c:887 passes `buf->page` from <linux/splice.h>,
 * where the field is `void *` because DCL's pipe_buffer has no page array
 * behind it. Adding the offset instead of dereferencing answers both forms
 * with one expression, and it answers them the same way -- __builtin_offsetof
 * needs no <stddef.h> and gives the exact displacement the `->` did.
 *
 * The argument is still read as a struct page pointer, which is what it is:
 * the alternative (treating it as a raw buffer) would silently shift a real
 * page by the refcount's four bytes.
