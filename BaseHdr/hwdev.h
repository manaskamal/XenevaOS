/**
 * Shared kernel/user ABI for /dev/hwdev -- hardware access for user-space drivers.
 *
 * Model: a process in the MISC_DAEMONS group (or root) opens /dev/hwdev and
 * asks for a PCI function with HWDEV_IOC_PCI_OPEN. On success it gets back a
 * NEW file descriptor, a capability for exactly that one device. Every
 * further operation (config access, BAR mapping, DMA buffers) is an ioctl on
 * that descriptor, and everything it grants is bounded by the device:
 *
 *   - config writes are limited to the command register and capability space,
 *     never the BARs, so a driver cannot re-point a device at kernel memory;
 *   - BAR mappings must lie inside a BAR of that device;
 *   - only PCI functions on the kernel's allowlist can be opened at all
 *     (default deny), and one that an in-kernel driver still owns is refused
 *     with HWDEV_E_BUSY: unload that driver first (see /dev/drvctl).
 *
 * Closing the descriptor, or exiting, unmaps and frees everything granted.
