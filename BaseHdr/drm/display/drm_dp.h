/*
 * The two definitions Vendored/drivers/video/hdmi.c needs from mainline's
 * 2245-line <drm/display/drm_dp.h>: its hdmi_audio_infoframe_pack_for_dp()
 * takes a struct dp_sdp and writes 0x1b into the SDP header's HB2 byte
 * (hdmi.c:511-519).  The rest of the header is the DP link-training/register
 * surface, none of which anything in this tree names -- it was never ported,
 * and this file exists so the one include resolves without it.  Grow it when
 * a consumer asks, the same rule the other BaseHdr stubs follow.
 *
 * mainline: include/drm/display/drm_dp.h:1718, :1727, :1759.
