/*
 * DCL <asm/io.h> -- port I/O accessors.
 *
 * ARM64 has no x86 I/O port space, but 8250's probe and PIO paths carry
 * inb/outb/inl/outl calls that must still *compile* even though every port we
 * intend to bind is MMIO (QEMU's pci-serial BAR, iMX8MP's UART -- both
 * reach registers through readb/writeb, already in <linux/kernel.h>).
 *
 * So these are honest failures, not silent ones: a read answers 0 and a write
 * drops, and the first of either logs once. 0 rather than 0xff on purpose --
 * an all-ones answer makes LSR look like "transmitter always empty", which
 * would let the driver believe it is talking to a live UART, while 0 says
 * "no line is ready" and drives every polling loop into its timeout and out
 * again. Failing toward the timeout is what keeps a misconfigured port from
 * becoming a boot hang.
 *
 * When a board that genuinely needs PIO shows up, the body becomes a window
 * (PCI I/O space is a mapping on ARM64, not an x86 instruction) and this
 * comment is the thing to delete.

 * ioremap()/iounmap() and the be32 accessors, reached the way a mainline
 * driver reaches them: through <asm/io.h>.
 *
 * DCL deliberately houses ioremap in <linux/io.h> rather than here (see the
 * note at the top of that header: on arm64 ioremap is a plain P2V, and it
 * belongs with the other map/unmap declarations).  The consequence was that
 * nothing included it -- every mainline source says <asm/io.h> and calls
 * ioremap, so 8250_port.c:2908 compiled as an implicit `int ioremap()` and
 * assigned the result to `void *port->membase`.  On this LLP64 target that is
 * not a warning to tolerate: the int is 32 bits, membase is 8, and the pointer
 * would have its top half zeroed before a single register was read through it.
 * Re-exporting the header here is what makes the declaration reach the
 * call sites that were always going to ask for it.
