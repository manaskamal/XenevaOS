 * DCL/serial_base_shim.c -- the serial core's device bus, minus the bus.
 *
 * serial_core.c links against seven symbols that mainline spreads across
 * three files -- serial_base_bus.c, serial_ctrl.c and serial_port.c -- and
 * none of them can come from source here, because all three are *driver
 * core* code.  They call device_initialize(), device_add(), bus_register(),
 * driver_register(), dev_set_name() and fwnode_handle_get().  DCL has no
 * driver core to call: <linux/fs.h>'s struct device is a pinned-layout blob
 * (kobj_name at 0, devt at 708, 800 bytes, with everything between declared
 * padding -- see the comment above it), and the driver core is what walks
 * those bytes.  Reconstructing it is a later stage, and is not what makes
 * 8250_port.c and serial_core.c work.
 *
 * So this file is the driver-core *contract* and nothing more.  What
 * serial_core.c actually needs from those three files is a small, closed
 * pointer graph, and that is what is implemented:
 *
 *   serial_core.c:3267  serial_base_ctrl_add(port, port->dev)
 *   serial_core.c:3275  serial_base_port_add(port, ctrl_dev)
 *   serial_core.c:3232  serial_core_get_ctrl_dev():
 *                           `struct device *dev = &port_dev->dev;`
 *                           `return to_serial_base_ctrl_device(dev->parent);`
 *
 * The third line is the one that decides this file's shape.  It is called
 * from serial_core_unregister_port() at :3345 with no NULL check, one
 * statement before the port is torn down.  Returning NULL from
 * serial_base_port_add() was the tempting answer -- every caller tolerates
 * it on the way *in*, because `IS_ERR(NULL)` is false -- and it would have
 * compiled, booted and linked clean, then read through a NULL pointer at
 * offset 64 the first time anything unregistered a port.  So both objects
 * are allocated for real, and port_dev->dev.parent is set to
 * &ctrl_dev->dev, which is what lets container_of() come back to the same
 * controller that registered the port.
 *
 * Sharing falls out of that rather than being implemented: serial_core_
 * ctrl_find() at :3247 walks the driver's state array comparing
 * uart_port->dev and ctrl_id, then *derives* the controller from
 * port_dev->dev.parent.  Two ports under one controller therefore end up
 * with one ctrl device, and :3359 drops it only once find() reports that no
 * ports are left -- the same lifetime mainline gets, without a refcount.
 *
 * All allocation is kzalloc: struct device carries kobj_name and devt, both
 * of which Xeneva's devfs reads back, and leaving them zero is what makes an
 * unregistered device look unregistered rather than look like device 0.
 *
 *   upstream  drivers/tty/serial/serial_base_bus.c (ctrl_add, port_add,
 *             both *_remove), serial_port.c (port_startup, port_shutdown),
 *             serial_core.c's own #else arm at include/linux/serial_core.h
 *             -- the console matcher.  The pointer graph, not the sysfs
 *             side, is what is ported; when the driver core lands, this
 *             whole file is the thing to delete.
