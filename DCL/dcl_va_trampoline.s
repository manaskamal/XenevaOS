/*
 * AAPCS64 variadic entry trampolines for module-facing shim functions.
 *
 * BaseHdr/stdarg.h has no __GNUC__ under aarch64-unknown-windows, so its
 * va_start is the hand-rolled "&last + 8" form that reads the callee's own
 * frame -- but AAPCS64 callers (kernel code and .ko modules alike) deliver
 * varargs in x1..x7.  Each stub below saves x0..x7, then tails into its
 * _Call twin with a pointer to the save area; the C side rebuilds va_list
 * from that pointer (varargs start right after each function's fixed args).
 * Same pattern as the UARTDebugOut trampoline in Hal/aa64_print.s.
