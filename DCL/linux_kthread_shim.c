/*
 * DCL/linux_kthread_shim.c -- kthread workers over the DCL workqueue.
 *
 * The vendored drm core runs its vblank and atomic-helper deferred work on
 * mainline's kthread_worker: drm_vblank_work.c creates one per CRTC with
 * kthread_run_worker() and queues/flushes/cancels through the four externs
 * below.  Xeneva has no scheduler to host a kthread, and DCL's workqueue
 * already runs work->func synchronously where it is queued (see
 * linux/workqueue.h) -- which collapses the worker to a trampoline:
 * kthread_queue_work() is the dispatch, and flush means "the work already
 * ran, there is nothing pending" because a pending state never existed.
 *
 * That is a real semantic narrowing and it is safe for one reason: mainline's
 * pending-work list (kthread_work.node) is checked under dev->event_lock by
 * drm_vblank_work_cancel_sync(), and with queueing synchronous the node is
 * always empty there -- the cancel answers "nothing was pending", which is
 * exactly true.  The vblank work itself therefore runs inside whatever
 * context queued it (the hrtimer callback or the flip handler), under spin
 * locks that are no-ops on this build.
 *
 * The rest of the file is the three primitives that belong beside it rather
 * than in a shim of their own:
 *
 *   completions -- the drm atomic helpers wait on commit milestones with
 *   complete_all()/try_wait_for_completion()/wait_for_completion*().  The
 *   state is the one `done` word <linux/completion.h> defines and the waits
 *   are the two observable states described there; the bodies are below,
 *   beside complete()/wait_for_completion_killable() in
 *   DCL/linux_kmod_shim.c which treat the same word the same way.
 *
 *   sched_set_fifo() -- drm_vblank_work.c promotes its worker to a
 *   real-time scheduling class; there is one task and no policy to set, so
 *   the call is the symbol and nothing else.
 *
 *   dcl_current_work/current_work() -- <linux/workqueue.h> declares the pair
 *   its inline runner maintains and drm_probe_helper.c reads; both were
 *   undefined at link, and the definitions are at the bottom with the note on
 *   why the live pointer is the only honest answer.
