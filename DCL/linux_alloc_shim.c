 * an empty shell -- so the kvmalloc family has no second path to take and
 * every block below is an ordinary TLSF block. What the missing second path
 * would have bought, and what its absence costs the callers, is noted at each
 * function.
 *
 * kfree_const()/kstrdup_const() are mm/util.c's rodata-aware pair; ksize() is
 * mm/slab_common.c's; kvasprintf() is lib/vsprintf.c's va_list formatter;
