 * DCL/linux_cmdline_shim.c -- lib/cmdline.c's three functions.

 * static inline in <linux/lib/cmdline.h> is at the top of that header: the
 * only caller cannot see the header.
 *
 * The caller is lib/string_helpers.c's parse_int_array() (:142-158), which is

 * get_range() -- expand the upper half of an M-N range into the caller's
 * array, and report how many numbers the range covered.
 *
 * `n` is how many slots are left; when it is 0 (the count-only call) the loop
 * writes nothing and only the count comes back. The decrement at the call
 * site is mainline's: it drops the last number of the range so the next
 * get_option() pass reads it as an ordinary value rather than applying the
 * range twice.
 *
 * The upper bound is parsed with simple_strtoull() rather than mainline's
 * simple_strtol(): get_options() documents its ranges as *positive* integers,
 * so the unsigned parse answers the same number for every value the function
 * can be handed -- and the cast keeps the arithmetic in `int`, where the
 * caller's `n` and `pint` already are.  (simple_strtol() itself arrived with
 * kstrtox.h:321 after this shim was written; the parse above does not need to
 * change to match mainline, because every value it is handed is positive by
 * contract.)

 * copy of the *calling* process's memory, which is not the same thing).

 *     buffer[res] = '\0';
 *     while (--res >= 0 && buffer[res] == '\0')

 * buffer[0] is a legal write, and the loop then steps res to -1 and stops, so
 * the caller sees an empty command line and frees the buffer. A negative
 * error would index before the start of the allocation instead.
