/*
 * DCL/drm_shmem_shim.c -- the drm_gem_shmem helper bodies the vendored
 * virtio-gpu driver links against.
 *
 * mainline's helper backs a GEM object with shmemfs pages reached through
 * the page cache, pins them on demand, and describes them with the sg
 * machinery. Xeneva has no shmem filesystem and no page cache. What it has
 * is the backing DCL/drm_stubs.c built for the dumb-buffer path in stage 2:
 * shmem_file_setup() allocates one physically contiguous buddy range,
 * zeroes it, and parks its base in filp->private_data, and
 * drm_gem_object_init() keeps that file as obj->filp.
 *
 * These bodies are that same backing wearing mainline's API. The object is
 * whatever drm_gem_shmem_init() makes of a driver-supplied struct --
 * virtio-gpu subclasses it (virtio_gpu_create_object() is its
 * gem_create_object hook, and the first-member chain is what lets
 * drm_gem_shmem_free() release the whole wrapper) -- the "pages" are a
 * one-entry sg_table whose buffer is the linear-map alias of the range, and
 * every question the page cache would answer is answered here with
 * P2V/P2V-inverse arithmetic.
 *
 * What is deliberately absent is the machinery for a backing that can move:
 * purge, madvise, partial eviction, swap-in. A contiguous buddy allocation
 * is resident from creation to free; there is nothing to evict, and a
 * shrinker that cannot shrink is a promise in the wrong direction. The
 * declarations left without bodies in drm_gem_shmem_helper.h are exactly
 * that set, so the linker is the check that no caller in this tree needs
 * one.
 *
 * Only virtio-gpu pulls this file in. bochs and vkms take the two
 * DRM_GEM_SHMEM_DRIVER_OPS symbols from DCL/drm_stubs.c
 * (drm_gem_shmem_dumb_create, drm_gem_shmem_prime_import_no_map), which
 * build the dcl_gem_dumb object those drivers' dumb buffers have always
 * used.
