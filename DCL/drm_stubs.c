 * rebuilt here from the primitives this target does have, and MAP_DUMB's
 * hook below turns the offset into a real user mapping.
 *
 * The backing range is one contiguous buddy allocation: physically
 * contiguous means the kernel linear map (P2V) already is the single
 * contiguous mapping drm_gem_fb_vmap() asks for -- no vmap() of a page
 * array, no struct page bookkeeping.  The "shmem file" is a kmalloc'd
 * struct file that exists only to be obj->filp; its private_data carries
 * the allocation base across drm_gem_object_init() (the only producer,
 * and it does `if (IS_ERR(filp)) return PTR_ERR(filp)`).  fput() here is
 * a no-op (linux_cdev_shim.c explains the absent file table), so the GEM
 * object's .free owns everything: frames, user mapping, file, itself.
 *
 * Userspace reaches the frames through MAP_DUMB: mainline's handler runs
 * first and produces the uapi's fake offset, then dcl_drm_ioctl_post()
 * below maps the same frames with PTE_AP_RW_USER and overwrites
 * args->offset with that address, so a client dereferences it directly.
 * When file-backed mmap arrives (the Linux-client layer) the fake offset

/* ── vblank: the frame tick a commit gets ──────────────────────────────── */

/*
 * dcl_drm_vblank_tick -- the frame boundary DCL commits get instead of a
 * vblank timer.
 *
 * <linux/hrtimer.h> documents the whole story: this target runs no timer
 * interrupt, so the callback the DRM core's vblank timer is armed with --
 * drm_vblank_timer_function() (drm_vblank.c:2175) -- never runs.  That one
 * callback is the only caller of the CRTC's handle_vblank_timeout hook,
 * and for vkms that hook is what queues the composer worker: the code that
 * reads every active plane's buffer, blends the frame and writes it into a
 * writeback job's framebuffer before signalling completion
 * (vkms_crtc.c:16).  Without a tick, a writeback job would be queued by
 * the commit and never run.
 *
 * So a successful commit ticks its CRTCs once here, from DCL's commit tail
 * below, which splices the call in between hw_done and the
 * wait_for_flip_done.  A commit is the frame boundary this target has,
 * which is the meaning the timer carries ("the frame is out"), and running
 * it at commit time makes the composer synchronous with the ioctl that
 * asked for the capture instead of racing a wall-clock period.  The call
 * itself is the timer callback's own dispatch (drm_vblank.c:2198): through
 * crtc->helper_private->handle_vblank_timeout when the CRTC has one -- the
 * public vtable entry (drm_modeset_helper_vtables.h:481), which for vkms is
 * where the composer is queued -- and drm_crtc_handle_vblank() directly
 * when it does not.  That else-arm is bochs's shape: a scanout with a timer
 * vblank and nothing else to run, whose counts and flip events live
 * entirely in it.  The hook is also where a page flip's
 * completion event is delivered -- vkms's starts with
 * drm_crtc_handle_vblank() (vkms_crtc.c:25), which sends the event armed by
 * DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_EVENT to the waiting file; the tail waits on that
 * delivery right after the tick, and the failed stage-4 gate is what the
 * placement answers -- tick after the ioctl, wait timing out its ten
 * seconds first.  Only the re-arm is not reproduced -- a timer has a next
 * expiry, a commit does not.
 *
 * Clearing the frame period first is what lets the tick count.  Either arm
 * advances the count through drm_crtc_handle_vblank() -> drm_handle_vblank()
 * -> drm_update_vblank_count() (drm_vblank.c:307), whose timestamp path
 * trusts the driver timestamp; on this target that comes from the hrtimer
 * expiry (drm_crtc_vblank_get_vblank_timeout(), drm_vblank.c:2291), which
 * only moves when the timer is re-armed -- the shim never fires, so the
 * count would sit frozen and an armed event's sequence would never be
 * passed.  framedur_ns = 0 picks the core's other path, the one for
 * hardware without a usable timestamp: one count per tick (`diff =
 * in_vblank_irq ? 1 : 0`, drm_vblank.c:355, with framedur_ns read into a
 * local at :314).  drm_calc_timestamping_constants() writes the period back
 * at the next vblank enable; every tick clears it again.
 *
 * A CRTC whose vblank is off is skipped: that is the state
 * drm_crtc_vblank_off() leaves behind on a commit that just disabled the
 * output, and drm_handle_vblank() answers a tick for it with "vblank not
 * enabled" noise (drm_vblank.c, the !vblank->enabled early return).
