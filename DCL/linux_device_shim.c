/*
 * DCL/linux_device_shim.c -- the device-model entry points the vendored drm
 * core calls at link time and DCL has no body for.
 *
 * Why these are functions and not macros or header inlines: mainline
 * declares every one of them as a function (device_is_registered and
 * dev_to_node are the two inlines, and those are in device.h), and the
 * callers compile them as ordinary calls.  With
 * -Wno-implicit-function-declaration on, a missing declaration is silent and
 * a missing body is a link error -- which is how this file came to exist
 * (the link named 19 undefined symbols).
 *
 * The declarations live where the calling file reaches them, each with its
 * why-comment: <linux/device.h> carries dev_driver_string, dev_printk,
 * dev_warn_once, platform_device_unregister, the dmem pair and
 * check_move_unevictable_folios; <linux/fwnode.h> carries fwnode_handle_put;
 * <drm/drm_utils.h> already carried drm_get_panel_orientation_quirk.
 * Nothing here re-declares one, so each definition below is checked against
 * the header prototype the caller saw.
 *
 * No license header and no doxygen, like the other DCL shims.

 * DCL's stdarg.h cannot rebuild (the note at the top of device.h says the

 * dev->kobj.name too; the level is dropped because every KERN_* is the empty
