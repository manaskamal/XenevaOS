/**
 * DCL/linux_splice_shim.c -- the pipe half of the splice ABI.
 *
 * <linux/splice.h> names this file as the home of these six, and they are
 * together because the reason they are all no-ops is one fact about DCL's
 * boot rather than six decisions: Xeneva's devfs bridge does not route splice,
 * so no port's .splice_write is ever entered and nothing can hold, take or
 * release a pipe buffer.
 *
 * That is worth stating plainly rather than burying, because two of them look
 * like they could be wrong for longer than that:
 *
 *   pipe_buf_try_steal -> false  sends virtio_console.c:866 down its copy arm
 *                              (alloc_page + memcpy + sg_set_page), which is
 *                              the arm that stays correct if splice is ever
 *                              wired up -- stealing would move a page the pipe
 *                              still points at.
 *   pipe_is_empty     -> 1      is the true answer for a pipe nobody can fill.
 *
 * splice_from_pipe() and copy_splice_read(), the two entry points a
 * file_operations table actually names, are in DCL/linux_mm_shim.c with the
 * rest of mem.c's fops backing; this file is the layer below them.
