/*
 * DCL/tty_io_shim.c -- drivers/tty/tty_io.c, cut down to what the tty core
 * around it can observe today.
 *
 * mainline's tty_io.c is 3672 lines, and the majority of them are pieces DCL
 * does not have yet.  The open path walks a struct file list (fdtable, fget,
 * alloc_file, tty_add_file); the registration path reserves a chrdev region
 * out of a table that says which majors are taken and hangs a struct class
 * off tty_class so sysfs can publish it; __tty_hangup() swaps f_ops out from
 * under every open file and sends SIGTTOU to the foreground group.  Those
 * need the VFS, the device model and POSIX job control, which is stage 5 --
 * vendoring tty_io.c then is what this file exists to be deleted by, so
 * every symbol defined here is one tty_io.c also defines and the two must
 * never meet in the same link.
 *
 * What is here is the rest, kept in mainline's shape so that the diff at
 * stage 5 is readable:
 *
 *   - the allocator and the driver table -- __tty_alloc_driver,
 *     tty_standard_install, tty_driver_kref_put, tty_register_driver and its
 *     unregister, tty_drivers, tty_std_termios.  These *run* rather than
 *     merely link: uart_register_driver() in serial_core.c drives them, and
 *     that is the path a stage-3 uart registration takes.
 *   - the device nodes -- tty_register_device_attr, tty_unregister_device,
 *     which go through device_create()/device_destroy() instead of
 *     kzalloc + device_register(), because DCL's device model is a table of
 *     devfs slots and not a sysfs tree (linux_cdev_shim.c).
 *   - the small tty-level operations the line discipline and the port layer
 *     call -- tty_write_lock, tty_wakeup, tty_send_xchar, __start_tty,
 *     tty_hangup, tty_kref_put, tty_name.
 *   - tty_check_change, which is not tty_io.c's at all: it belongs to
 *     drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c, which is vendored out here for the same
 *     reason tty_io.c is (it needs tasklist_lock, signal_struct.tty_old_pgrp
 *     and kill_pgrp).
 *
 * Six departures from mainline's bodies, each marked where it happens:
 * the chrdev region, the cdev layer, the procfs registration, the hangup's
 * file table, the flow-control wrappers, and hung_up_tty_fops.  None of them
 * changes behaviour any staged caller can see, because none of those callers
 * can reach the thing that would have made it observable.

 * a fixed major) and fails the registration if the range is spoken for.  DCL
 * has no such table: the devfs slot lookup keyed by devt
 * (linux_cdev_shim.c, _dcl_devs[]) is what a node is found by, and the node
 * name -- built by dcl_tty_line_name() from driver->name -- is what two
 * drivers would actually collide on.  So the major is a counter in this file,
 * starting at 4: the first driver that asks for one gets the number mainline's
 * static tty devices sit at, which is the number a caller that left major at 0
 * was in effect asking for, and each later one gets its own.  A driver that
 * set a major keeps it and is handed no check, because there is no table to
 * disagree with.
 *
 * The workqueue.  mainline creates a per-driver flip workqueue unless
 * TTY_DRIVER_NO_WORKQUEUE, and links each port's flip work to it.  DCL's
 * work_struct runs inline (workqueue.h:56), so a queue to run it on is a
 * queue of one and flip_wq would be set only to be destroyed; it is left
 * NULL, which is also what mainline leaves it for a driver that opted out.
 *
 * proc_tty_register_driver().  There is no procfs; see destruct above.
 *
 * The list add and the INSTALLED flag are mainline's, in mainline's order --
 * add first, then instantiate the devices, then mark it installed, so that a
 * failure partway leaves a driver on the list but not installed, and
 * destruct_tty_driver() will not try to unregister devices that were never

 * device model is device_create() -> _dcl_devs[] + a /dev node
 * (linux_cdev_shim.c), which does the allocation, the name, the devt and the
 * node in one step -- so the whole first half collapses into one call and
 * the cdev attach has no counterpart: there is no file_operations table per
 * minor to attach, only the devfs slot the node was registered with.
 *
 * The pieces kept are the ones that are this function's own job rather than
 * the device model's: the index bounds check with mainline's message, the
 * name, and the freeing of a saved termios entry.  That last one is the
 * reason the array is walked at all -- it clears the lazy state out of a
 * minor that is about to be handed to a *different* tty, so the new one
 * starts from the driver's defaults instead of inheriting the previous
 * occupant's speed (tty_init_termios() above reads it).
 *
 * attr_grp is DCL's, unused: mainline hands it to the device so sysfs can
 * publish the attribute group, and there is no sysfs.
