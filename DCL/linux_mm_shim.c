/**
 * DCL/linux_mm_shim.c -- the runtime behind the drivers/char ABI surface.
 *
 * Implements what vendored mainline sources (DCL/mem.c first) call but Xeneva
 * does not provide natively: the user-access family, the physical-memory
 * window for /dev/mem, lockdown/capability gates, the tty_init() placeholder,
 * and the /dev/random + /dev/urandom + /dev/kmsg fops.
 *
 * Two design points, both deliberate:
 *
 *  - uaccess is a direct copy. Xeneva runs a syscall with the calling
 *    process's page tables live and the devfs bridge already hands raw user
 *    pointers to ->read/->write, so there is no boundary to cross. The
 *    mainline return contract (bytes NOT copied; 0 == success) is preserved
 *    so mainline `if (copy_to_user(...)) return -EFAULT;` branches behave
 *    exactly as upstream. A VMA probe can later sit behind access_ok()
 *    without touching a single caller.
 *
 *  - /dev/random + /dev/urandom read the real hardware RNG
 *    (hwrng_read_bytes -> virtio_rng.ko) instead of vendoring mainline's
 *    ChaCha20 pool. Entropy stays entropy; DCL just does not re-implement
 *    the pool to get it.
 *
 * Timing note: nothing here spins or polls on a deadline, so the adapter
 * stays off the jitter-sensitive paths -- audio periods and vblank remain
 * inside the native cores.
