/**
 * DCL/linux_hvc_shim.c -- the five hvc entry points virtio_console.c calls.
 *
 * The hvc core (drivers/tty/hvc/hvc_console.c) is the tty half of the console
 * port: it owns the console registration, the tty_struct and the flip-buffer
 * plumbing that would carry bytes out to the console. None of that is vendored,
 * and DCL does not have a tty to hand them to yet -- so what a console port
 * needs is these five, which are the module's own references to that core.
 *
 * The header they are declared in is vendored beside the driver that includes
 * it, at Vendored/drivers/tty/hvc/hvc_console.h (mainline's own
 * `#include "../tty/hvc/hvc_console.h"` is relative to the driver, so it has
 * to sit there rather than in BaseHdr/linux/). This file includes it too, on
 * purpose: `struct hvc_struct` is dereferenced by the *driver*, not only by
 * the core -- notifier_add_vio() writes hp->irq_requested (virtio_console.c:
 * :1591), find_port_by_vtermno() reads hp->vtermno, and hvc_resize()'s inline
 * in that header takes &hp->lock -- so a hand-typed prototype here would be a
 * promise the compiler could not check, and C would link it either way.
 *
 * Without a `-device virtconsole` on the QEMU command line no console port is
 * ever created and none of these run; ports work through the cdev path in
 * DCL/linux_cdev_shim.c regardless of whether the console side is wired.

 * The whole struct, not a stand-in with the first few fields in common: the
 * driver and the header's own inline reach into it (see the file comment), so
 * every field has to be where mainline puts it, which is what including
 * hvc_console.h above guarantees. outbuf is a flexible array in mainline's
 * layout, so the allocation carries the requested size after the struct --
 * `sizeof + outbuf_size`, mainline's struct_size() with the rounding it does
 * for an array aligned to sizeof(long).
 *
 * Zeroed first. DCL's kmalloc hands back whatever the TLSF free list last
 * held, and this block's `port` (tty_port), `lock` and `tty_resize`
 * (work_struct) are all read before anything writes them: hvc_resize() takes
 * &hp->lock on the very next use, and a work_struct that is not zeroed is
 * not an unqueued one.
